1,"My daughter and I had a wonderful stay with Maura. She kept in close touch with us throughout the day as we weren't arriving til later in the evening. The room was charming and the whole apartment was very warm and eclectic. She asked us what time we'd like breakfast and laid out a very nice spread. Right down the street from Jamaica Pond and very close to Center St. as well. All in all, great experience!"
2,"We stay at Elizabeth's place for 3 nights in October 2014.
The apartment is really a great place to stay. 
Lovely decorated and extremely well located. Very close to Back Bay station if you come by train, and close also to the subway and just a nice walk from the city center. 

I would say that is better that what you appreciate in the pictures
Also the bed is very confortable.
So really it was an optimal choice for us."
3,"If you're staying in South Boston, this is a terrific place to camp out. The apartment and bedroom are lovely, Ellie is an excellent host, and there is a lot within walking distance in a neighborhood on the rise."
4,"Derian and Brian were great and prompt with their communications with us. The room was as described; it was a small nice and clean room with a very comfortable bed and pillows. We shared a bathroom with others in the apartment. Derian had turned on the AC in our room prior to our arrival which we appreciated a lot. He also greeted us kindly when we arrived and showed us around. We arrived late and left early in the morning to catch our flight, so unfortunately, we did not get a chance to meet Brian or to talk much with Derian. "
5,John and Dan were gracious hosts and the location and accommodations were very nice......as listed.
6,"The best thing about Sean's place is the location. It's by a T station, there are a number of groceries and restaurants around, etc. It was nice to see all the drawings he made while studying architecture. The building is a bit old so walls are a bit thinner but overall it was a nice place to be.

Sean was great in answering phone calls and questions. He was there to meet us when we got to the place."
7,"Tom was very welcoming and available for easy access into the condo. It was just lovey and looked just like the pictures posted. We found the location to be very convenient to the city,  quiet, and perfect. Overall, our trip was most enjoyable. Thanks Tom. "
8,"I had a nice stay at Benjamin's apartment. It's very well located. There are public parkings very close, it was really accommodating. I would definitely recommend it!"
9,"Totally accurate pictures and descriptions.  A fun place to stay in the North End.  Great bed, very clean, very user friendly!  I would stay here again."
10,"Shelley was so nice and helpful. I could tell that this wasn't her first rodeo when it comes to renting out her space. She was really well prepared for guests and ready/willing to answer any questions we had. I also really enjoyed her sweet cats. The tiger/grey one was so sweet, almost dog-like. The room was cozy and comfy, there were an ample amount of fresh towels, and the water pressure in the shower was really nice. I would equate the neighborhood to Crown Heights/East Flatbush in Brooklyn -- not as clean as Brooklyn Heights, but not particularly dangerous. Easy access to the T. Cute, old home that I would highly recommend to friends. "
11,"We loved the location of this studio apartment. It was walking distance to  centre of town, Newbury Street and other tourist activities. It is situated in a beautiful building on a pretty tree lined street and has a stunning outlook onto the Charles River."
12,"Both the owner and the apt manager were VERY responsive. Quick, thorough replies and very proactive. They were welcome to deal with as a business traveler.

I used this apt as an alternative to the crazy hotel room prices downtown...and the horrible bed bug problem Boston hotels are NOT dealing with. The getting of the keys and instructions on using the apt are very well thought out.

The North End, and Hanover St is the heart of it!  It's busy day and night. Do not take this apt if you are seeking peace and tranquility. It's acurately described as a ""lively"" area. You have immediate access to great restaurants.

The apt is cooled by two window units. Thankfully, both were going when I arrived. They did a good job of cooling the rooms. The second floor, which houses the bed and bathroom is as described. If you want soft sheets, I recommend you bring your own. I'm fanatical about having all-cotton bedding which this apt does not have. The towels and bathroom supplies are all clean and as expected. Nothing fancy, but perfectly functional.

The kitchen is small, but complete. I barely used it except for glassware.  I noticed a tumbler had a small crack in it and then stupidly used it. When washing the glasses the next morning, it shattered. I'm not sure its something the cleaning crew would normally catch, but there it was.  I cleaned up the glass and my cut and left a larger than normal tip for the cleaners and note that there was broken glass in the garbage.

Overall, this was a positive experience which I would reuse."
13,"Molly, the house, the neighborhood...all were fantastic! Everything was true to description. "
14,"Casey was super friendly, the place was very cozy and comfy! She did everything in her ability to make my stay enjoyable and it was! Zoey being super fluffy and adorable is a definite plus. "
15,"I had a great time at Christine's.
The place was spacious, well decorated and as noted earlier, perfectly located.

The communication and check in/out instructions were effective.  

I'd absolutely recommend Christine's place and stay again, if she'd have me."
16,"I had an amazing stay at Miriam's place! The studio apt is private, adorable and has everything you need! Great location and great flexible hosts! I'd most certainly stay here again! "
17,"This was the second time that I stayed at Monicas, this time I actually met her in person and she is very friendly. Upon my arrival she offered me a coffee and a piece of an amzingly delicious zucchini cake. Even though her cafe was closed that day.  It was very interesting to talk to her about her cafe and traveling experiences. The location is super close to the airport and everything is as in the description. I love the proximity to the airport and would come back every time I'll go through Boston. "
18,Perfect! My time here was too short! It was a pleasure to meet everyone there. I only wish was that I had not been so busy with work to have gotten a chance to know more about the city in general. The proximity to the T made getting in and out of town very simple. Thank you for being such a great host!
19,"Great location, very close to Park Street station and Boston Common. Clean and exactly as illustrated in the picture. Great views of Boston skyline from the roof deck. Henry and Lisa were super accommodating and messaged me about one week prior to my stay to organise what time I could pick up the keys. Henry met me and my family in the apartment lobby, showed us around and made sure we had everything we needed. Would highly recommend.  "
20,Our stay in Laurie's apt was very comfortable and convenient. This was a last minute reservation and she was very quick to respond to all of our inquiries. The location is very convenient and with a beautiful view of the city. Parking is easy to find and restaurants and nightlife are withing walking distance.  
21,My family and I enjoyed our weekend at this very clean and comfortable apartment.  The unit was stocked with necessary items and the porch was an added benefit that we didn't expect.  The host was very responsive anytime I reached out with a question.  I've stayed in other vacation rentals and this was by far the best experience I've ever had.
22,As pictured. Quite clean. Parking on the side of the house was appreciated! Water pressure in the shower was quite weak.
23,"We stayed at Brian and Lisa's place during the coldest time of the year. That did not hinder us since we received a warm welcome, heated room, warm bed, and many extras. The special care provided by the hosts such as the guidebooks, charliecards for public transport, and provisions such as coffee and tea made our stay extra pleasant."
24,"Very nice appartment in the middle of Little Italy. We had everything we needed, even a bottle of wine and water in the fridge. Very clean.
Peferct for 2 adults and 2  children. We can recommend it."
25,The place was clean and quiet. Exactly as described.
26,everything is good.
27,Very pleasant neighborhood and charming house. The hosts were very nice and quick to respond to texts/emails. It was a great base for us to explore Boston - a quick walk or Hubway bike to the metro station.
28,"Staying at Katy's place was a very nice expercience! She is a lovely person, who respects your privacy and if you want to talk or have any quetions, she is happy to help or just to sit down for a chat. 
The room has everything you need (+a very comfy chair), the bathroom and the kitchen are clean. Another plus were the washing mashine and the dryer that I could use. 
It takes you about 15-20 minutes to Harvard, about 35-40 minutes to Park Street in Boston. Bus and T go all the time, so I never had to wait too long. There are a few nice shops and restaurants close to Katy's house.
"
29,"From arrival to departure it was an absolute pleasure staying at Rachel home!  Not only was Rachel's home beautifully decorated, but it was perfectly situated in the city with access to great restaurants, grocery stores and easy access to the 'T'.  

I would defiantly recommend staying at Rachel's home.   "
30,"It was very comfortable room and neighbourhood is very convenient, I spend great 3days. I couldn't meet Jade, but I appreciate so much.
Hope to stay again when I visit boston !"
31,"Everything was great.  A stunning location, spacious, quiet, clean room with an incredible view overlooking the city.  George even went the extra mile, providing travel literature in-room, along with drinking glasses, and a few other essentials for use during our stay.  The location itself is amazing as well, right in the heart of Boston, within easy walking distance of just about everything you could possibly want to see and do.  George was really helpful and provided several useful tips for our stay as well."
32,"Overall a good experience. This home was in a good location and the city was easy to get to. Everything in the home worked well especially the air conditioning for the hot days. The block was quiet for the most part in a decent area and there was always a parking spot out front for us. I suggest this listing to anyone that plans on spending sometime in Boston. Also Terry was good, he let us be and replied ASAP whenever we had a question."
33,"Liam was very accommodating and a very gracious host.  The accommodations are very simple and are exactly as advertised. The location is great with a few good eateries in the immediate area.  The proximity to the T system is excellent.  The neighborhood is working folks and everyone is in motion all of the time.  Because of the high traffic, I would consider this area to be generally safe.  I parked my car on the street and got a ticket on the fourth night.  $25 (cheaper than a parking garage)   I give this place a thumbs up and a positive representative of the AirBNB network.  Thanks Liam."
34,Juliet is a very caring and energetic host.  She responded to our wishes promptly and went beyond our expectations to make sure that we were comfortable during our stay.  Juliet's home is beautiful as well as immaculate.  It was very convenient for us to go into Boston once we acquainted ourselves with the transit system.  Roslindale is a quiet and cozy community.   We would definitely recommend Juliet's home to others who would wish to rent it.
35,"The room description was accurate in terms of the size and basic facilities. My host Sylvia wasn't present for the stay. Unfortunately, the room itself hadn't been cleaned and I had to hoover it myself upon arrival. The bathroom was especially dirty and not at all pleasant to use. Similarly, the kitchen was very unclean and had quite limited utensils for cooking - other housemates tended to leave dishes unwashed for days at a time. The neighborhood was lively and quite conveniently situated, but the cleanliness of the apartment was a major problem."
36,"You get what you pay for and you don't pay much for this place. It is like a hostel, with several single rooms and shared bathroom. Clean, but not much else. Bed and table are shaky. Good if you're on a tight budget and just need a cheap place to crash for a night. They're strict about check-out times. "
37,"First, to set the stage - I initially wrote Tom at roughly 1am on Monday, inquiring about his property for later that night through Thursday.  He had replied before I woke up at 6am - and was the only one of four people I had reached out to who was flexible enough to accommodate my impromptu work trip.  Their place was exactly as described, in a great neighborhood - and a welcome change to the normality (and expense) of life in hotels.  I will definitely be reaching out Tom first (and hopefully with more notice) for future trips to Boston.  Everything was easy and accommodating.  No complaints.  "
38,It's a decent room with great location. I would recommend it to anyone.
39,"Michelle's apartment was fantastic! There are so many positives about this place: location, size, amenities both in the apartment and nearby. I utterly enjoyed my stay and it proved to be an ideal spot for discovering Boston; the 's very close to public transportation and bike sharing. The room was comfortable, tidy and much more spacious than expected. On top of that, sheets, towels and everything else you need were included. 
I also delighted in chatting and sharing stories with my flat mates and my welcoming host. I loved our baking session!
What more can I say? It was perfect. Definetely recommended!"
40,"Great place. Although no elevator, but don't take heavy luggage with you. Travel light. 
Would stay there next time "
41,"The apartment was nice, the location was great...lots of places to eat, shopping, things to do.  Close to train stop.  Very nice experience.  Will stay again.  Thank you."
42,"Danielle was a great host with a wealth of local knowledge that really made a positive impact on my stay in Boston.  The accommodations were as good as advertised and the short walk to the T station was a huge bonus.  Everything was clean and cozy and Danielle saw to seemingly every detail. Coffee, tea, towels, shampoo, ironing board, restaurant advice, and homemade cookies were all part of the experience.

I will definitely look Danielle up on my next trip to Boston.

"
43,"Small yet well provided with all the necessities plus all sorts of thoughtful extras. Our hosts were friendly and helpful despite their busy schedules. Unsettled weather prevented us using the deck very much, which was a pity as it would have been a great extension to the studio. Altogether a very good stay."
44,Howard was a great host. The apartment us located in a very nice district of Boston. Lot's of restaurants and shops. Definitely would recommend staying here.
45,The apartment was adorable and clean. It had a great view of Fenway park and was in a fantastic location. It was a great place for us to spend the night but would not recommend for someone needing somewhere during the day. We had to leave our things in the apartment when it was not yet cleaned from the guests the night before. 
46,"Great experience.  Our family trip was a disjointed one,but Lyralen and Judy made us feel welcomed and ""rolled with it!"""
47,"Room was clean and nicely prepared when we arrived. Nicole was more than helpful with all my questions about Boston. Quiet and private lockable room. Newly painted kitchen with full access to stove , microwave and refrigerator. Close to bus stop, grocery store and plenty of pubs/ restaurants. Plenty of on street parking also. "
48,"My experience with Margaret was nothing short of fantastic. She was very accommodating and polite. Our flight had been delayed and we got to the house later than expected but it wasn't a problem because we were able to get hold of Margaret straight away.
The house was very clean and our rooms were incredibly laid out. She even made us breakfast in the morning and we had a lovely chat about life in Boston. Not only that but she even drove us to the station the when it was time to leave.
I would definitely stay with Margaret again if I am next in Boston. It's my first experience with Airbnb and I've got to say that my stay surpassed all expectations. It was absolutely fantastic"
49,"Two of us stayed at Joseph's studio for five nights in April 2015. It is well located, the Boston Public Garden is across the street and Arlington metro station is a 450m walk along the Arlington Street. Joseph is easily reachable and replies quickly.  We picked up the keys at the Taj Hotel concierge, 300m from the apartment building. Some few furnishings in the studio are different as in the pictures, but overall is the same. Nothing that will impact your stay. Internet Wi-Fi worked well. The coin laundry in the ground floor was very convenient. I would stay here again."
50,"It is exactly as advertised.  He provides a bedroom (as pictured) in his 2 bedroom apartment, which is the second floor of a 3 floor walkup, about 10 minute walk from the subway and 20 minute subway from downtown.  He is super friendly and happy to give advice about how to enjoy the city.

The apartment has a full kitchen (fridge, toaster, and oven/stove) and washer and dryer (though we didn't use any of this).

There are also 2 balconies (again we didn't use these, but they looked nice).

The place has wifi and free street parking (note you have to be careful which side of the street you park on Thursday because of street cleaning rules).

If you are looking for luxury accomodations, this isn't it.  However if you are (like my fiance and I were), looking for very reasonably priced, simple accomodations with free parking and wifi, and easy accesibility to the subway, this is it.  As a bonus, Jesse was very easy to communicate with and always responded to messaged within an hour or so."
51," I was a little apprehensive for my first airbnb  experience.... Staying in a private home of people I'd never met was worrisome.  Well I could not have had a more perfect first experience!  From initial text correspondence onward, Jez and Ken were exemplary hosts. Their home is beautiful. Very well appointed. They think of everything! (A welcome cookie!!). Within minutes of my arrival I felt like I was a guest in the home of friends I had known for years.  They accommodated my late arrival.... Picked me up at the airport and dropped me off at the T.   I visit Boston annually and I will always check availability here before I stay anywhere else. "
52,"Excellent location. Close to everything. Very clean, enjoyed the place very much"
53,"Bernardo was excellent - he was quick to respond to all of my questions when they arose. The apartment was charming and exactly as expected. The neighborhood is friendly, conveniently located and includes a Starbucks :) Bernardo had prepared a stack of literature on things to do in Boston, wifi information, take out menus and house rules. I would definitely stay with Bernardo again and recommend his place to boston travelers."
54,"The flat is perfect. It was very comfortable and clean, the subway is just  10 min walk. Soledad was not here but very flexible , she allowed us to arrive earlier to have the time to visit Boston, Phoeboe was here to welcome us, she was very nice. 
It was a first great Air Bnb experience."
55,"Gerald was a great host, very easy to chat too, very accomodating, full of helpful information. Sky his puppy is hilarious, and kept us entertained. Position of duplex great, easy walk to everything. Nice neighbourhood. All our expectations met. It was a pleasure to have met Gerald on our adventures. "
56,"Comfortable and spacious room in a quiet neighborhood, just a 10 minute walk from the subway station (Orange line). Michelle is the perfect host: welcoming, helpful, nice..and she's also an excellent cook!  There's a fast wi-fi connection and the kitchen is well-equipped! I spent 1 month here..and I felt home!
Renting a bike can be a great way to go to work as well as to explore the city.
"
57,"My mom and her best friend stayed in Sean's apartment for a few days, and they enjoyed the stay. They loved the location and they knew it would be a small space so that was not a problem for them, besides it had everything they needed. They said the unit could use some minor repairs but nothing too serious. They were very happy with Sean as a host, they said they didn't have a single problem during the stay even though their English is limited!"
58,"Communication from Jeff was prompt and clear. Loved renting from him. He got us a parking garage for an extra fee, which was much appreciated. Parking in Boston is an issue, and we did have difficulty when we first arrived even finding a spot to drop off our luggage in front of the building - we finally saw you could come through the alley next to the building so made a quick stop there.  The location of the apartment is perfect for sightseeing.  The apartment has central air which worked well and was appreciated, because many of the other places we were looking at did not.  We felt safe coming and going at night, and never even used the Metro even though it was very close by. We walked to the Aquarium, North End, ate at Fanieul Hall and walked the Freedom Trail, went to the movies one night, and never took our car out. There is an upscale grocery store around the corner, as well as a CVS right down the street if you need anything. 

The apartment is extremely clean. It's close quarters for 4 people, the sofabed is in the same room as the kitchen, opening the sofabed fills up much of the room, and the bathroom is off the bedroom.  Jeff is very thoughtful, providing coffee, tea, umbrellas, a hair dryer, and quarters for the washing machine in the building basement. There is a small desk but no dining table - for breakfast we were able to seat our kids at the desk in the alcove, but with so many great restaurants to choose from, we ate out for the rest of the meals, so we only used the fridge, toaster, coffeemaker, dishwasher and microwave.   Would definitely stay here again if we returned to Boston, highly recommend. "
59,"We had a great time staying with Jez and Ken.  The room was clean, well set out and had some extra touches like brochures, toiletries and cookies that made it special. The bed was really comfortable. The house was really cute and the cats were very friendly. The location is really good - a 20 minute walk to then catch the T straight into the middle of Boston. Jez and Ken were very friendly, warm and extremely generous - on our first day Ken gave us a tour of the area and when we left he offered to take us to the bus station.  They know the area really well and have lots of good ideas about places to eat, things to do and how to make the most of your time - they are great to talk to.  We really enjoyed spending time with them in their beautiful home and would recommend their place to anyone wanting to explore Boston."
60,The bed was comfortable and the location was great. The room was also surprisingly very quiet. The room needed a good dusting and the bathroom was not the cleanest but the host had just had eye surgery the day before we arrived as well as car and computer drama so it might not have been her best week. The linens were clean and the breakfast well-presented. 
61,"My husband and I had a great experience staying at Sara and Pam's place when we were visiting Boston for a wedding. Arrival and key pickup were smooth and pleasant. During the weekend we had a chance to chat with both Sara and Pam, who are kind, friendly, and helpful people, and we loved their cat, Derby. The upstairs area where we stayed--bedroom and super roomy bathroom--was clean, comfortable, and stocked not only with basics such as towels and soap, but nice extras like snacks and a Keurig coffee maker. The house itself is quiet and peaceful, and there was definitely a sense of privacy and independence for our entire stay. We had access to the kitchen, though we ate every meal out and primarily just used the kitchen to grab glasses of water, which is of course essential. The only downside to staying in this area of Jamaica Plain was the blaring music out of car windows during certain parts of the weekend, and some other city noises, but this didn't bother us too much. The house isn't too far a walk from the Green St. T stop, so we used this (as well as Hubway bike share) to get into other parts of Boston. A couple cute cafes are on the way to the train, and we enjoyed these, as well as some other restaurants in downtown JP (along Center Street). And one of the nicest things about JP is surely all the natural spaces, like Jamaica Pond and the Emerald Necklace parks. We didn't get a chance to see the Arnold Arboretum, so we will surely have to come back sometime. Overall, I would say Sara and Pam's place is an amazing bargain, a great spot to anchor your trip to Boston, and not at all too far from the city center if you're willing to navigate public transit."
62,Nice little apartment in a great part of the city.
63,"The accommodation in Hermina's house was very comfortable and all household amenities were accessible.  I did not meet Hermina in person but we were often in communication via e-mail and phone, and she made sure that I had everything I needed.

The location is very good for travelling in and out of downtown Boston (it only takes around 15-20 minutes), and there are lots of local shops in the neighbourhood.

All in all I would recommend staying here if you want somewhere reasonable to sleep while you explore the historic city of Boston."
64,"The place was very nice, handy for shopping, a ten minute walk to the Orange line and we encountered no difficulties."
65,"Sean was a great host! Communicative, nice, accommodating, friendly. 

The room was exactly as described. It's a cute little studio in a nice location in Boston a short walk away from the Brigham & Women's hospital, a perfect place to stay if you're interviewing at the hospital/medical school. The room was warm and clean, the bedding freshly laundered, the bed was very comfortable. I would definitely stay there again if I'm ever in Boston and would recommend Sean's place to all my friends. "
66,Great experience!  Jane was really nice and the location was conveniently close to Boston College.  I would stay there again.
67,Cute place! Awesome communication! Really helpful! Victoria and her husband are really sweet and helpful. The Olav was spotless and directions and interactions were all great! Thank you so much for welcoming us!!
68,"The Beacon Hill location is just great! An easy walk to a couple of subway lines, lovely historical ambience, and good restaurants a block away on Charles. I was delighted to find that I was near the esplanade along the river and could dangle my feet in the water after a long day of museum going. I found the apartment to be pretty warm with only a fan, but otherwise I was quite comfy."
69,"The location is awesome!! Its just a couple of blocks from South Station, close to great restaurants, and bars and the VIEW!! couldn't have picked a better location. The Boston Tea Party Museum is close too.  "
70,"Alexandra's apartment is centrally located and very close to the Green Line which makes it convenient. Her apartment is newly renovated. Alexandra was easy to communicate via airbnb messaging (don't email her since she does not check it often). The room has a nice closet, towels and she even left new slippers for guests. The room is very dark at night and in the morning since the window faces another building. 

I do wish we would have realized ahead of time that the bed was a modified futon. The pad was thicker than your normal futon, but the back support was not all that great. My parents were actually supposed to stay here while visiting Boston and after one night we had to switch because my dad had back problems. "
71,"I stayed at Phyllis's house for two nights, she is very nice and hospitable. She picked me up at the airport at night and helped me settle down. The house is very artistic and elegant, and though the room is tiny, it is well-equipped and comfortable. Definitely perfect for one!"
72,The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
73,"The Charlestown location was beautiful and our apartment was conveniently located within walking distance to the Hop-On Hop-Off tour bus at USS Constitution, the local shops (where there was a fabulous food store called Whole Foods), and even within walking distance to Downtown Boston City. 

We enjoyed the convenience of being able to do our laundry and to have meals at home if we wished, but found the apartment a little stuffy and overheated. We felt that the apartment would benefit from some de-cluttering (to make the space appear bigger) as it looked in the photos. It would also be a good idea to check the status of the provided toiletries between each new booking, as we were left with an empty bottle of body wash.

More attention to detail in cleaning would have been appreciated - the toaster oven was full of crumbs, we found some medication under the bed and we some underwear caught up in our doona cover. The linen was of poor quality and didn't reflect the description in the listing. The shower was a bit problematic as we had to climb over the spa bath wall to get into it, not an easy task for us shorties!

Despite these hiccup we enjoyed our stay and found Corey helpful, friendly and attentive."
74,"Location is perfect! Only steps to Boston Common, State House, subway and downtown. Room was clean and well kept. Tiffany, the host, was also very helpful with directions and local tips upon my arrival and during the stay. Great value!"
75,The reservation was canceled 95 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
76,The host was very communicative. The accommodations were as described and comfortable. 
77,"Katerina's apartment was so great! Perfect location, walking distance to star market and public transportation. Will absolutely use this place again whenever I am in Boston! "
78,Listing description accurate.  Great neighborhood.  
79,"Balint was great and super trusting.  Though we never met face to face he was very accessible through texting if we did ever need anything.  This place was super close to the Orange Line Green St. station and that was huge to be able to get in and out of the city with relative ease.  Just park your car at the place and walk over to the ""T"", 5 minutes maybe, head into the city for a few hours and come back w/out having to touch your car keys.  The neighborhood was very nice, there was a beautiful cafe right near the T that we ate at and would highly recommend.  Very highly recommended place to stay and host to chat with.  "
80,"Great stay! I had been planning my trip for awhile and Sean was available for contact before and during my stay. Smooth, easy, and fun stay with a great host!"
81,"For the price you cannot beat this in the Boston area.  Reasonably close to Boston, 45 minutes on T or if you take a cab it's $20 and it still takes about 30 minutes depending on traffic.  

Just remember this is an AirBnB stay.  Everything is nice but it is not perfect.  It's better than the Fenway Park Howard Johnson's for quality but it is definitely not a 4 star hotel and the price is appropriately reflected.  

One issue that we'd like feedback from the host on.  There was no key to the individual rooms.  I had some items I would prefer to keep locked but there wasn't a key available.

Otherwise it was a nice stay for however short it was.  "
82,this place was perfect quit relaxing comfortable and clean 
83,"Marisa and Lin were both quick to respond and helpful. The condo was perfect for our needs - offering an excellent location, stylish, comfortable furnishings, and a responsive, prepared host. We were visiting as a family, with 2 adults and 2 kids. It was cozy since there are essentially 2 rooms, plus bath and tiny kitchen. But the purpose of our visit was not to stay indoors. The location at the top of Beacon Hill was what attracted us. We walked or took the T most days of our 6 day stay. We walked to the North End, walked to Newbury Street thru the Commons and even walked back from Bunker Hill in Charlestown across the bridge. We did rent a car for 2 days of our trip and were able to make do with about $4 in quarters to pay for a few hours of on street parking behind the State House between 8am-8pm. In the condo, everything is new and very clean. The bed was very comfortable, and the kids were okay with the couch pull-out bed. The kitchen is tiny but well-equipped and functional, especially if you're just using it to prepare snacks or reheat leftovers as we were. The bathroom is small, but like the rest of the condo, well-designed, well-appointed and efficient. Sheets, towels, blankets were all new and great quality. And, yes, the view from the roof deck is memorable and stunning. I would stay here again if I return to Boston."
84,Location is golden. We walked everywhere! Anthony was easy going and very nice. The place is as pictured. Seeing as it is a basement it can get quite damp but that did not bother us. It was a great place to rest in between all the wonderful things to see and do in Boston!
85,"Kelly was so amazing and so accommodating! We had lots of changes with our plans and she was really nice and made sure we could get in and check out when we needed to. The place is nice and the location is great for going to Fenway since it's only a few minutes walk. Thanks for being such a great host, Kelly!"
86,We had a very nice stay at the airbnb of Liza (and her family). The house is beautiful and has a great atmosphere. It was a pleasure to sleep there and the location is perfect for visiting Boston. The metro is near to the house and within minutes you're in the city centre. Liza and her family are very welcoming and helpful. We would definitly recommend a stay at this airbnb when you want to visit Boston!
87,"This cozy apartment was perfect for what we were looking for. It was super-clean and in a very convenient location. Charlotte even left us chocolate covered almonds and bottled water for our arrival, and a thoughtful list of instructions and area attractions. We had a fantastic time and Charlotte was a great host. "
88,"I felt so lucky that I had chosen Duane's place every day of the two weeks I stayed at his place. From before I came till after I had left Duane was the most helpful host I could ever imagine, making my stay in Boston so much easier and more fun. I also felt at home at his place right away, hanging in his lovely sofa everyday after a long day. Everyday would start with his friendly question if I was ready for coffee and home baked bread and I would sit and look out his window looking at the beatiful view out at Boston from his window enjoying my breakfast greatly. With Duane's interest in how I was doing and all his help we became friends and I will remember my stay at Duane's as a wonderful thing about Boston. Also don't worry about the transportation into downtown, I stayed at Duane's place for almost two weeks and went into downtown everyday and it was really no problem. One last thing.. I always felt secure in the neighborhood, it was a cozy area. I would choose Duane's place if I should ever come back to Boston and I would highly recommend Staying at Duane's to anybody going to Boston. The bottom line is that I would wish that a review like this could express how happy I was about staying at Duane's."
89,"Robin was a great and easy host. She helped me figure out the best ways to navigate Boston for some tightly scheduled meetings. And, she was flexible with my flight coming in after midnight.

It's just what I expected at this price point. It's like crashing with a friend on a comfy couch."
90,Robert was a great host during my short stay in Boston. His place was centrally located and convenient to everything. He was very kind and attentive. I would definitely consider staying at his place in the future.
91,"Jimi's apartment is very well situated (near parks, restaurants, public transportation, etc!). It's not too big and the building is not so recent, but for Boston's standards, this is a pretty decent place and we all fell comfortable. Very nice people in the building too. The reserved parking was a big plus for us. 

We didn't have the chance to meet Jimi, but he was a great host. He even left some fresh coffee beans and local beer for our use! His instructions were simple to follow and we enjoyed our stay at his place.

Thanks Jimi for hosting us!"
92,Stephen and Megan were extremely hospitable and we had a wonderful time staying in their lovely home. They even recommended a great breakfast place within walking distance as icing on top of the cake! We would highly recommend their listing to anyone staying in the Boston area that wants quick and easy access to downtown.
93,The reservation was canceled 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
94,"The apartment is in PERFECT location and very comfortable and spacious for 3. 

BUT... the instructions to get there could have been clearer and the communication with the hostess better. The apartment is inside a place with some food places, and then you have to buzz to a tailor studio(3f), who opened us the door, but didn't know anything about Kimberly's place. We felt quite lost at that point. We decided to knock on another door before leaving, and the previous guests were still there, but no news about Kimberly, although we had told her in advance at what time we were arriving, and she had told us she would be there. Her friend told us later that her phone died that day, but still we have the feeling she or him could have tried to contact us by other ways to let us know in advance about it. "
95,"Fantastic location in the Back Bay, close to all that the area has to offer. The unit was clean and comfortable, and the bedrooms were on opposite sides of the unit which allowed more privacy. We had a great stay and would definitely book here again!!"
96,"Tia was amazing! Very attentive to your needs as a guest and overall a very nice person. Stayed there for 10 weeks and was overall a nice experience. It's in a college town so there will sometimes be noise on Thursday nights or weekends, but I was OK with my earplugs. The T stop is a few mins walk away and there is a Shaws (supermarket) close to the stop. Lots of places to eat close by too. Muffin the dog will bark at you the first times he sees you but afterwards [so long as you like animals] he'll gain your trust quickly. Lastly Tia is down to take you out sometimes, so it's all up to you and what you feel. I was very busy for most of my stay but went out a few times and left as friends. Would stay there again!  "
97,"We had a great stay in Lawrence's appartment! The location is perfect if you want to stay in the Beacon Hill area. It is super central yet it is not noisy. The flat itself is somewhat old and could maybe use an update, but it is clean and tidy.

It was VERY hot outside during our stay. The air conditioning kept the bedroom cold, but the living room/kitchen was quite warm. Lawrence is a nice and responsive host that quickly followed up on the questions we had. He was also very frank and allright about a water leakage issue with the air conditioning, which did not cause us any major issues for us.

Be aware that you will need to pay for Wifi usage ($12 for 1GB quota - cheaper gb/rates for larger quotas). Thanks for a great stay!"
98,"ken and  Jez made our first airbnb such a wonderful experience. We had a lovely room with an exceptionally comfy mattress  in their comfortable , clean  beautiful home. What set the experience apart was the warmness of Ken and Jez. We were repeatedly checked on , invited to share the living room and kitchen and to help ourselves to whatever we may want. A space was set up specifically for us with dishes, cereal, snacks and the like. We were dropped off at the t station and offered a little side trip on the way of a beautiful vantage point for viewing the city. Ken and Jez offered suggestions for Boston in a day tours and checked in later to get feedback on how our experience was.  Cookies placed in our room for a late night sweet was icing on the top of an exceptional experience.  Can you rate over 5 stars? They deserve more! Convince to both airport and public transport was a++"
99,"I was so lucky to find Becky's designers haven for my 3 days stay in Boston! not only the apartment is a rare gem, wisely renovated and crafted to be welcoming and warm, the roofdeck and backyard simply worthy a visit, subway at a 5 mins walking distance, but the people who live there are really special. Len was a great host, it happened that I got my luggage lost at the airport..and he provided me with whatever I needed, from his coat to his backpack bag! Becky,who was abroad during my visit,texted me a couple of times to know if everything was alright with me and the apt. They simply took care of me! Not to mention that she got me a special price cause one of her friends (a phenomenal chocolatier from NY) was visiting too for the weekend! Needless to say I look forward to coming back soon! "
100,Steffen is an excellent host.  He was very accomodating and pleasant and made me feel at home.  Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to talk with Steffen more or explore Allston but it is a lovely apartment in a great neighborhood.  
101,"My girlfriend and I stayed in this room for a night after flying into Boston, before travelling on. Like many other visitors, we didn't meet Izzy but he responded very quickly by text when we had a question on the day, and it was nice to meet the other guests staying in the house. The room was cosy and warm despite the snow outside, and the kitchen and bathroom were clean. There is a  code access system on the front door which was very handy, and we were able to leave our luggage in the living room after we had checked out while we visited the Boston centre. Overall, really good value room."
102,"Great location that is close to the T trains and Boston Common. Lots of good restaurants and pubs. Close to many of Boston's attractions. The apartment was clean and compact but fully equipped with a comfortable bed. We always felt safe in the apartment. If we return to Boston in the future we would stay here again, if it is available."
103,"I had a good stay at this place. I did not stay in the room as shown in the figure. I stayed in some another room which he kept ready for me. The room as well as the linen were clean. He also provided a pair of towels for me to use as I did not have any. The neighborhood is in a residential area and it was peaceful. However, visitors should note that they need to share a common toilet (washroom). "
104,Fantastic room and bathroom; discreet yet charming hostess. Little touches gave it much more of a human touch than a hotel room. This was my first stay in this type of accommodation and I'd highly recommend it for anyone on their own in Boston who wants somewhere welcoming and comfortable to stay without having to pay a fortune. 
105,The airbnb experience with Izzy was fantastic. Very easy to get to location. Clean towels and good shower. Bed was comfortable. Room was perfect for our needs. We landed late in Boston due to a delayed flight but the way we were instructed to collect keys meant that this was not an issue. Would definitely stay with izzy again if flying into the city in the future. 
106,"Steven was super nice and helpful.  His apartment is extremely clean and exactly like the pictures. The location was perfect and is a very short walk to the subway. I highly recommend Steven's place  to anyone who is looking for a place to stay in Boston.

Thank you again Steven for all of your help! 



"
107,"We agree with the other reviews that the place is quirky and very funky. When we arrived the heat didn't work, but Donna had someone out the next day to fix it and that was appreciated. When we requested a blender (for the marathoner in the group), she had a new one there for us. The location was indeed perfect with a small market two blocks away and a Whole Foods nearby.  Donna even provided a wheeled shopping cart. The hill where the apt. is located is pretty steep, if you are not accustomed to walking them. We found the apt. not in the good condition as other people experienced it. (Donna had some medical issues and perhaps that was the reason that detailed care had not been taken in cleaning.) We found the converted sauna (the closet), shower, and the covered hot tub (the bed) in the back bedroom just not to our liking. If anyone has issues with disabilities, this may not be the place for you: steep entry stairs with no handrail, odd step up to the back bedroom. There are no towel racks in the bathroom or near the shower. We felt the price was fair and the location was great.  On the day of our departure our flight left in the early evening and Donna graciously allowed us to stay as late as we needed."
108,Emmanuel was a wonderful host. He was very helpful and thoughtful and easily accessible. We would definitely stay at his home again. A spacious and beautiful home with a lovely back yard and garden. A great location. It is just a very short walk to Arnold Arboretum and Jamaica Pond. Only 12 min drive to Brookline.
109,Lisa is the greatest host I ever met. She prepared breakfast for us and helped me with parking. The location is good. It is easy for you to use transportation passes. She also provides cookies and water on our bedroom. Definitely 5 star.
110,Great place at an excellent location in Boston.  Thank you Nathaniel!  
111,"Wonderful host who made our first trip to Boston a positive and memorable experience! From start to finish, everything was easy and stress-free in terms of checking in and out. The apartment was cozy with a notably comfortable bed. Fully equipped kitchen with selection of coffee and teas for guests. The most noteworthy aspect of our stay here was the perfect location of the apartment in a quaint yet bustling area of town with numerous cafes, delicious restaurants (Giacamos!!!) and pastry shops literally within a couple blocks, yet a few subway stops away from the main downtown area or even walking distance. Highly recommend renting from Owen!!! You will not regret it. I could not imagine being in a better location in Boston. "
112,"Jose's apartment was perfect for my needs. The location is terrific; it is set far from the street and underground, so is very quiet; and Jose is an understanding and accommodating host. I stayed 4 nights and did not encounter any problems.  Unlike other guests, I found the mattress to be comfortable. I slept easily, no problem. I highly recommend!"
113,"Susan was very communicative and flexible as I worked to arrange my visit to the area. She made planning easy, and when I got there, she and Steve welcomed me and checked in to make sure things were going well but were not at all imposing -- the perfect balance. The description of the cottage is accurate, and I absolutely loved my days there. It is cozy, comfortable, and well equipped. There was a LOT of snow when I was there, so I didn't get to see the gardens or surrounding area, but Susan kept the path clear and the cottage was accessible -- no small feat in such weather. I look forward to returning to this delightful getaway the next time I am in the area. Thank you, Susan and Steve!"
114,"Richard is the best! He is very considerate and responsible. Before my arrival, he called several times to confirm my check-in time so he could welcome us personally. The room is nice and sweet. Richard and his wife even prepared delicious desserts and fruits in the fridge, as well as milk, yogurt and water. Richard is definitely the best host I have met through Airbnb!"
115,Fanny is great person always ready to help. Room and house were very clean. Bus stop is close to house. I am very satisfied.
116,"Liam was a great host - very intelligent and cheerful. You should stay here just because of him! Also, the place was very clean and comfy. And only a minute from subway. I definitely wish to stay here next time I will be in Boston!"
117,Marlo was an awesome host. My friend and I had the entire apt to ourselves for the weekend. Area is really quiet and nice apt is super clean would definitely recommend this place. 20-30 mins to boston city center. 
118,"This is a great place to stay!
We spent 8 nights at the Rosenbergs, and had a very good experience.
The rooms were cosy and with a lot of space. They are located on the upper floor of the house so you have your privacy during the stay.
Mrs. Rosenberg took care of everything! She was more than just helpful and we felt like old friends or family members. She treated us more than just a host.
The unit includes 2 rooms, one of them with private shower and toilets. In between, there's a small living room where you can have a breakfast, which was actually supplied by the host!
If you have children- this is a very good place for you! The Rosenbergs have everything you need, including toys!
The location is good enough- just few minutes walk from the T train.
Few things you should know, which are not a badfeedback but just an info:
The rooms are on the upper floor, so if you have any difficulties, you should care about this.
There is no double bad- so if you are a couple and care about it, you should be aware.
For us, it was not a big deal and we did not feel it as a disadvantage.
The bottom line- if we will return to Boston again, we would probably stay at the same place.

בעברית:
המקום מאוד מומלץ. משפחת רוזנברג מארחת למופת. 
גב' רוזנברג עשתה עבורנו מעל ומעבר, דברים שהם מעבר למה שהייתם מצפים, ועל כן תודתנו והערכתנו.
החדרים מרווחים ונוחים, הניקיון נשמר במהלך השהות, המגבות מוחלפות לאחר מספר ימים.
בין החדרים יש חלל פתוח המהווה מעין חדר אוכל לאורחים, הכולל מקרר קטן, שולחן וכסאות. גב' רוזנברג דאגה באופן קבוע לאוכל ושתיה עבורנו, גם אם לא הייתה ממש חייבת.
המיקום בסה""כ טוב. אם אתם מחפשים דירה במרכז העיר, כמובן שזה לא המקום עבורכם, אך אם אתם מחפשים מקום מרווח, במיקום נוח ובמחיר סביר- זה המקום עבורכם.
המקום מומלץ מאוד למשפחות עם ילדים- אחד מ-2 החדרים כולל מיטות נוער ותינוק, והמון צעצועים ומשחקי ילדים.
2 פרטים שחשוב שתדעו מראש, על מנת לתאם ציפיות:
החדר הזוגי כולל מיטה נפתחת ולא מיטה זוגית.
החדרים נמצאים בקומה השניה של הבית.
לנו זה לא הפריע, היתרונות היון גלומים בפרטיות ובשקט שעמד לרשותנ ובמהלך השהייה.
לסיכום- אם היינו חוזרים שוב לבוסטון, כנראה שהיינו מתארחים שוב אצל משפחת רוזנברג."
119,This place is fantastic. She definitely knows how to treat her guests. Beautiful apartment with all the amenities you could want. 
120,"Bedroom and bathroom was nice, clean and as described/on pictures. Interaction with the hosts Judy and Lyralen was short but very pleasant and comfortable. Coordination and communication was quick, easy and convenient. Street parking was limited but I was able to find a spot both times I needed to. Judy and Lyralen had a lot of extra conveniences (well stocked fridge, toiletries and towels). Would definitely stay again/recommend others."
121,"Carol and her home exceeded our expectations as a first time client to an airbnb ! Carol greeted us as we arrived and provided us with a letter full of helpful information ! The bedroom we stayed in was clean , cozy and private .  The location of her house on a beautiful tree lined street was quiet , safe and convenient ! Great restaurants , a store and the Train into Boston were just a short walk from her home ! I would highly suggest this host and her lovely home to anyone who is staying in the Boston area . Thank you Carol, for your services... Excellent ! "
122,Anya was a great host -- communicative and helpful.
123,"This apartment is ideally located in front of the Orient height station. It is really clean and the parking is a real plus. Check in and check out was very easy.
Gavin was very helpful, responding very quickly to all messages and allowing us to leave the car few more hours before taking our plane on our last day.
We really recommend this place! 
"
124,"The place is fantastic and the host Jimi is so considerate, you can almost find everything you need in his place! Have a really good time there, definitely will be back someday!"
125,The apartment was very well equipped and everything was clean and worked as it should. The location is ideal for travelers!!!Thank you.
126,Nik and Molly are great hosts and their apartment is quite charming and roomy. Our three night stay was just great. There was a nice little pub just around the corner and the T was close by as well. I would highly recommend staying with them.
127,"My stay was perfect.  Susan is a generous and accommodating host.  Her communications prior and after booking were always prompt, clear and helpful. This was particularly notable as I found myself making a reservation last minute on a weekend around a complicated work travel schedule. Susan graciously offered me best times to communicate with her, allowed a late check in and after arrival was invaluable in helping me sort out how to get to my various meetings efficiently.  This was further enhanced by the convenience of her location, fast efficient public transport into the heart of Boston is literally around the corner. Access to the highways for travel to my meetings outside of Boston was also easy by car. The room was simple but comfortable.  The entire space is very clean (note shoes off policy bring your slippers), comfortable, quiet and private.  The ability to come and go and be pretty much left to my own devices was of great value to me.  As it turned out I found Susan so interesting and engaging I<80><99>m afraid I ended up seeking out her company more then was fair.  She also provided the most delicious baked cranberry bread and fruit salad at breakfast <80><93> which she kindly sent me home with for the long drive the last day.  I would also recommend trying to plan a 10-15 minute walk up and down Melville Ave and some of the side streets to gawk at the beautiful Victorians <80><93> really a spectacular collection of Victorian homes."
128,"This was our first airbnb experience and to be honest: it was ambiguous.
First i have to say that there is a lot of space, you have your private floor and they provide shampoo and soup so you don<b4>t have to take care of those things (which is very kind and convenient).
BUT there were a few strange things: you have to go through a very cluttered and dirty room to get to the private room. I don<b4>t understand why they leave this place so cruddy...moreover the fridge in our room was full of mold. "
129,Awesome experience with Lifestyle
130,Place is exactly as described. Loved the location. Would stay here again and again. WIFI was slow but that was easily remedied by longing into a stronger unprotected signal.  
131,Lisa was extremely helpful from before I even showed up at her house. She answered all of my questions quickly. Her home is spacious and very clean. A fresh breakfast is put out every morning. Clean sheets and towels are provided. The bathroom is right outside of your room which is convenient. Lisa offers complimentary unlimited T passes which are a big money saver and also very convenient. The bus stops right across the street from her house. If we had more time we would have taken advantage of Lisa's impressive game collection. I would definitely stay here again when in Boston. 
132,"We had a lovely time staying with Salman and Nabihah! Their home is very bright, clean, and cozy, and they made us feel totally welcome and at home. We wish we could have hung out with them more, as they are a lovely young couple, unfortunately our trip to Boston was busy and short. We like dogs, so we got to know their little dog Toto and enjoyed his playful spirit very much. Salman & Nabihah's house is very conveniently located, especially to Fenway Park, so we were able to walk to and from the Red Sox night game that we attended (Go Sox). The section of Brookline that they live in is very residential, with two T stops nearby (Brookline Village and Longwood). It is full of pretty homes and quiet streets. During the day we parked on the street, and at night we parked in a parking lot about a 10 minute walk away. All in all, it was the best experience. Highly recommended!!"
133,"I spent a very pleasant night in Phyllis' JP condo and I would have stayed longer if it had been available.  The bed was comfortable, the room quiet, the bathroom and shower were fine.  I enjoyed talking with Phyllis while enjoying her coffee in the morning.  Her cat was sweet.  It was nice that it was a bottom floor apartment without many steps to manage.  I may return to JP, and if so, would be glad to stay there again."
134,"I do not have enough nice things to say about this place and these people! The location was incredible; great views, and easy access to the green line... seemed like everything was one stop away in any direction, and we walked to and from the T through the Common which was really nice! The apartment was extremely comfortable, quiet, clean, and had everything we needed. It is small as you can see in the photos, but for two people who really just needed a pillow at night and a shower in the morning, it suited us just fine. The hosts were very helpful and responsive and on time. I hope that if I ever get the chance to be in Boston again, this place is available to stay in because I already miss having my morning coffee on the roofdeck!!! "
135,Paul is a super nice person. His place is clean and trendy. Very inviting. I loved that he had air conditioning as the temps outside were 90 degrees during my visit. The area surrounding his apartment appears older and some places are rundown. Yet Paul's place is up to date and I felt quite safe. 
136,"Beautiful brownstone apartment. Spotlessly clean and super comfortable in a great location. The host, Oine, was exemplary and very responsive and organized. Highly recommended. "
137,"Victoria and Tim's home and hosting were perfectly accommodating. Great location in quiet and lovely circle around a small park.  Just around the corner from the MBTA with little need to transfer more than once (except to/from airport). Boston is easily enjoyed on foot and the day(s) passes are a terrific value. As a host myself, I not only recommend, but look forward to staying again in Victoria and Tim's home the next time I'm in Boston."
138,The location was perfect for walking to all the famous Boston sites. I loved that we walked down the stairs of a neighborhood building just like locals. The room was clean and comfortable with a great bed and cold AC. We would book here again in a heartbeat. 
139,"The apartment was lovely. The location is right in the center of Beacon Hill, such a gorgeous neighborhood. Sean was a great host, so helpful and always available to answer any questions. I would recommend this apartment to anyone that is planning on visiting Boston."
140,"We were very happy to stay on this place, the apartment was wonderful, warm, charming, with everything that you could need, completely new and as is presented on the web.

Jason was concerned about us all the trip, and very easy to communicate. 

The neighbourhood was very interesting, full of places to eat, shop and enjoy, and the people very pleasant.

We strongly recommend this place."
141,Michelle is an awesome host! She met me at the Roxbury Crossing T station when I arrived and showed me the neighborhood. The house is very nice. The room is perfect for one person but I suppose a couple would have no problems either. Everything was clean and tidy. Michelle makes awesome granola bars and muffins and the coffee is delicious:). She filled me in on what was going on in the city and suggested various attractions. I will definitely stay with her again if I'm in Boston again. 
142,I couldn't have picked a better place to stay.  Charlestown was fantastic and staying so close. To Bunkerhill Monument made it even more memorable. The bed and couch was very comfortable. Their surroundings were clean and quiet. Every place we wanted to visit was with in a $20 cab ride. When we had extra time we would take the T Or the bus and it was super simple and inexpensive. The homeowners were kind and caring and occasionally checked up on us to make sure we were happy. I truly can't think of a way it would've been a better experience. She also makes one hell of a banana bread ;-).
143,"After a sudden flight change that landed me in Boston, I needed a bedroom within 30 minutes of Boston Logan airport. Because of the short notice, hotel prices were outrageous. Once again, Airbnb was a lifesaver. 

I think this has been the best Airbnb experience yet. Amanda and her fiancé are incredible hosts; polite, kind, easy to talk to, and considerate. They provided a private room in the basement, with access to a private bathroom and shower. In the bedroom, Amanda pointed out a television with Netflix and an Apple TV, coffee and tea, and envelopes container her recommendations for local food and activities. 

Honestly, I wish that I could have stayed longer than one night. 

Also, if you like coffee, be sure to check out Ula. They make a mean Americano, and it's right around the corner.  "
144,"We absolutely enjoyed our 2 nights in this perfect apartment!
Kasia and Adrian welcomed us at the door and showed us the apartment and provided us with all the information (wifi, door codes, directions to supermarkets, etc.) we needed when we arrived.
The apartment was lovely prepared with some fruits, coffee and milk in the fridge.
We loved having breakfast outside in the beautiful arranged garden and relaxing there in the evening after a long sightseeing day.

The Andrew t station is just a few walking minutes away and provides fast connection to the city.

All in all we had a perfect stay and would definitively stay there again!"
145,The house is clean and convenient. It is near T station and we enjoy our stay here. The only problem is that three rooms share one bathroom. 
146,"Our stay in Paul's apt couldn't be better! The apt is great and clean, exactly how it looks from the pics! Paul is extremely attentive host, always very helpful and went extra lenghts to make us feel welcome! A great experience: definetely worth it!"
147,"Taskin was very friendly and welcoming. House & room were clean.

House is very easy to access and close to the Orange Line. Very good position to visit Boston."
148,"Very private room. Host did not bother us at all and we were free to come and go as we wanted. Felt safe leaving belongings in the room while we were away. Location was great. We walked most places and went to Fenway for a game, which was literally around the corner, which was fantastic. Recommended."
149,"Our experience could not have been better. What a killer location to stay in- close to everything including a two minute walk to Fenway Park! Highly recommended for anyone's stay in Boston. Quiet, comfortable and in a safe neighbourhood."
150,"The space was good for what I needed. The check-in was easy and the host was quite flexible and very communicative. 

I hadn't realized that the bathroom was shared with several other rooms. But I didn't have any trouble. In fact, I didn't see any other guests while I was there.

"
151,"Tasking was nice, well knowledgeable and welcoming. His place was quite. Overall i had a good stay. The upper floor room may benefit by extra fan."
152,"Location was great, right in the heart of North End. Apartment was small but clean. Advertised for 5 people, but had only room for 4.Our directions said that apartment was next door to realty where we picked up the keys. After trying to break in (unsuccessfully) into that apartment building, we called and found out that it was 4 blocks away. Steep and narrow stairs, so if any mobility issues, do not rent.  But generally all was well, a lot cheaper that 2 hotel rooms . "
153,"We had an excellent experience on this apartment, we spent some wonderful days visiting Boston, and it was really comfortable for us.

The department is about 4 blocks from the airport, with a perfect location if you need to go to the airport or the subway station on foot."
154,"Everything was great.  A little hard to find in the dark but only took a few extra minutes to figure out.  The room is very quiet, except the little fridge goes on every hour or so but I'm a light sleeper.  No TV but I didn't have time to watch one.  It has a little kitchen with micro and 1 burner if you want a kitchen.  Pillows were very comfortable.  The bed is high and comfortable."
155,I really liked the accommodations. The location is also within a very short walking distance to the Four Corners / Geneva station and so really close to downtown. I also liked the breakfast and the attention received. High recommend.
156,"Exactly as listed, and as seen in the photos provided. Great location, walking distance to everything. Silverline SL1 transit bus takes you from/to South Station and Logan airport in 20 minutes, South station being less than 5 minute walk from the apartment. 

If you come from abroad, there's a T-mobile store on your way from South Station to the apartment where you can pick up SIM card for your unlocked phone. 

Whole Foods South End is located about three blocks south of the apartment."
157,"Clean, private room, easy parking, close to public transport to Boston. Lovely chilled out resident cat called Jake. We asked to use two bowls & spoons for the cereal & milk we brought with us for our breakfast. No, Carlos doesn't like guests to use his bowls or utensils so the kitchen is a no go area. It's a pity he didn't have some just for his AirBnB guests to use. Carlos was kind to allow us to have an early checkin for which we were grateful. "
158,Tiffany had a great place! She had everything arranged before our arrival and was in constant communication. The subway was only a short walk away. Would definitely consider staying again.
159,"The apartment was lovely for our four night stay and it is conveniently located to get in to town as well as Fenway opposite the flat! The instructions for check in and out were clear and easy to follow and even though we never met Sean he always responded promptly and was very helpful. The local neighbourhood is fantastic - lots of lovely places to eat, Star Market for groceries and a variety of shops. It's an excellent price and I would recommend it."
160,"Sidney is a very friendly host and prepared for us some fruits, water, milk etc.
His appartement is perfectly located in the southend and a good base to explore Boston by bike or foot.
We will stay at Sidneys again when we come back to Boston"
161,"Jesse is a friendly and easygoing person. He responded to messages quickly and gave great, detailed directions on how to get to his place from the airport. Because of that, finding his place was fairly easy and not an issue at all. The room is big enough for two people and the bed was comfortable. 

Nearby his place are a few Vietnamese restaurants serving delicious meals and sandwiches. These are good options for a filling meal or quick lunch just minutes away from his place or on your way to the subway line.

Overall, I had a positive experience with Jesse and at his apartment!"
162,"Frankly I was expecting a little bit more from this apartment. I mean it is cheap and is exactly as in the picture, but my wifi was supers low, the bathroom was quite messy and not so clean and my bed did have any linen... No air conditioning, so was super hot during the night I spend there. I mean is fine the price, but they could improve a little bit the facilities and the cleanness ;)"
163,I enjoyed my stay.  The room was modest but comfortable and fit my needs perfectly. Monique and family were charming and helpful. Checking in and out was seamless. The neighborhood was nice and within a mile of the Westin / convention center.
164,This apartment is truly lovely. It's in a great neighborhood close to everything. The setting is private and roomy. I highly recommend it. 
165,"Fantastic stay. The apartment was excellent, the neighbourhood is genuine and interesting, with good dining options, and Brooke was a pleasure to deal with. She provided very helpful tips, and was responsible for me using the Hubway cycling scheme - even though I was in town for work. I got a few questions about it as I peddled up to the convention center and everyone else was jumping out of cabs. "
166,Manuela is very accommodating. I stayed for an entire month and all of my questions and requests were always quickly and professionally addressed. The T isn't even a minute walk away and the grocery is a 3 minute walk and a T stop away. Would definitely suggest to a friend.
167,"Maria is an excellent hostess and her home is lovely. The room is large, clean & very comfortable, with A/C in window. Excellent private bathroom with plush towels. Maria offers  nice continental breakfast and made me a delicious latte!"
168,"Ellen and Ed were wonderful host, very welcoming and always disponible for my questions. The room and apartment is totally similar to the picture, in other words a great place (very clean, well decorated, bright and confortable). The room was actually bigger than what I expected from the pictures.

 I had a wonderful three week stay with them and there two lovely cats and would definetly recommand the place to anyone wanting to stay in Boston ! "
169,"This is a nice studio if all you need is a place to stay, nothing too fancy, so dont expect too much. Location is convenient, only steps from Green Line which will get you to most POIs near Downtown in less than 20 mins but remember to have your tickets purchased in advance. Price and location wise, this is a great place. And the host Sean, has been nice and helpful."
170,"Gillian was a wonderful host. Our flight arrived late on a Friday and she unbegrudgingly met us and gave a quick orientation session. 

The lodgings were better than the listing! We were very comfortable and felt welcome. 

The apartment is really close to the T and is within easy walking distance to most attractions. "
171,"Although I haven't seen Robert or Jacky at all during my stay due to my busy schedule while in Boston, I could feel their hospitality in many ways: towels, guides to Boston and many more was provided and plentyful. Same for literature; they always have the book for you to read! House and rooms are also in a good state and royal indeed. Definitely recommendable to anyone who looks for a royal and affordable place in Boston!"
172,"Ed was a fantastic host!  He opened up his home and ensured we had everything we needed.  The accommodations are exactly what he advertises and the neighborhood was like looking at post cards of Boston, very quiet and safe.  The penthouse has a beautiful roof top deck with amazing views of downtown Boston.  A great place to unwind after walking the city all day.  The bedrooms are private with your own bathroom and the house was very clean.  Will definitely book again with Ed on my return trip to Boston! "
173,"Absolutely recommend using SleepAfloat.  Never slept or been on a houseboat before.  Was a great break from staying at hotels and enjoyed the ocean breeze.      

The only thing that takes getting used to is the gentle rocking of the boat.  But that goes along with being on a houseboat.   I am complete land lover and quickly got used to the rocking. "
174,Hermina is great. I had an awsome time staying in her house. She keeps everything very clean. The house is so convenient to get around. I recommend here for people who come to Boston for a short visit.
175,"Even though hiccups in our Amtrak transportation forced us to arrive rather late at night, Jeff was available to welcome us to his home and get us settled in. 

The house is comfortable and, as promised, right on the bus line to the T station - but we also were able to walk to the T station as well. The house also has a lovely backyard patio for those times you might like to just sit and/or read.

"
176,"Sarah and her family are friendly and accommodating hosts! Sarah was extremely flexible in in my arrival and departure times. She and I enjoyed nice conversation over a traditional dish from her home country the first evening I arrived, and her brother even offered to make me breakfast in the days during my stay. The room is exactly as it appears in picture. The location is great for anyone visiting/attending Boston University. Only a 10 minute walk from the campus and BU Medical Center. Also, the location is great for the use of public transport. Only about 5 minute walk to local bus stop, with Dudley Station nearby. I would recommend bringing a small blanket if booking during the winter season, as the room can get a bit chilly at night. Otherwise I found the accommodations quite comfortable. I would highly recommend staying with Sarah and her family! "
177,"Kathe was such a great host. She was very kind and helpful. She was also very accommodating with our very early arrival. We loved exploring the city, and the property is very close to public transportation. Thanks again, Kathe!"
178,"Chris and Claire were extremely welcoming and accommodating. The room was perfect for a couple with plenty of space ans room to put our belongings. The apartment is perfectly located in the great South End neighborhood, with easy access to public transit. We would certainly stay again and recommend to others. "
179,"Hermina was a lovely, warm host. We came in very late in the evening with only a day or two of warning--1AM, and she was awake to greet us and to show us her place. The accommodations were very comfortable and spacious. Her home is also very beautiful with vibrant colors on the inside. Another plus-very close to public transit--about a 5-minute walk or less to the Red Line, which takes you through downtown to cambridge area and beyond. Thank you, Hermina!"
180,"We didn't see Roger because he was on vocation, but the lication is very convenient and close to everywhere "
181,"Our one night stay was fine. While we wouldn<80><99>t have wanted to spend any more time in the apt. than necessary, it proved to be okay for our purposes, which essentially was a bed and bath for the night. The bed was fairly comfortable, but the futon/couch was far from it. My wife was a little put off by the sign near the entrance warning of rats in the alleyway, and the closet door that fell off when she touched it. I had to remind her that we were not at the Ritz, and our initial foray into Airbnb was an adventure of sorts.  My only word of caution is that people in the apt. above (this was a basement apt.) can be heard as if they are in the same room as you. This includes every footstep etc.  We were glad that we had remembered to bring along earplugs.  Overall, it was a pretty much Spartan, but adequate. Jose was very pleasant to deal with."
182,Very welcoming!
183,"Great place! Clean, location is amazing, very communicative host. Would stay again."
184,"I was in town for a conference at various locations throughout the city and this place was perfectly situated to allow me to get everywhere fast. I was up before the host every morning and home reasonably late (sometimes at 1 am), which wasn't a problem.

The place is small but clean and comfortable (good mattress!) and the cat Lucky makes for a fun stay. The pictures are honest and give you a very good impression of the place.

Prior to arriving I did not read the listing properly and assumed there would be internet. This is not the case but there is a wholefoods with free wifi very close by that is open till 11pm, and during the summer you can comfortably sit outside. There is also some seating with power outlets indoors.

Doing laundry was no problem, the place has a decent shower and the host, Laura, is easygoing and friendly.

As others have mentioned, Jason is your first point of contact, which, while a little unusual, wont matter once you get there.

If you value a good nights sleep (soothing rain noises included!) in a convenient location for a reasonable price (I paid 50 dollars a night), this is a good place."
185,"Mohammed was a great host, greeted me upon arrival. Everything a guest could need was provided. Definitely recommended! "
186,Overall it was great. I think the space could have been a bit cleaner. It was very stuffy at first and had a damp smell to it while we there. 
187,"Giuseppe was a great host, very helpful and responsive, cool guy.

The room itself was just what I was looking for, small but cozy, relatively quiet, fast wifi. It was nice to have my own sink in the room as well.

I stayed for almost a month, and would definitely stay there again!"
188,"Lisa was a great host; we felt very welcome and would absolutely stay there again. It feels like a bed and breakfast or hostel, as there are multiple guest rooms. The free Charlie passes are awesome and the T is a short walk from the house. Breakfast and tea/coffee in the morning is great, too. Lisa also had a bunch of suggestions for us to make the most of our short time in Boston. "
189,"This place truly is a gem! Gina was wonderful, responsive and full of great recommendations! We could not have asked for a better location. So much was within walking distance and the local restaurants were divine! I highly recommend this Northside gem to anyone looking for a great place in Boston!"
190,Great place and very helpful/welcome host. Plenty of easy parking and great vietnamese food around the area. Would stay again if needed to.
191,"Me and my friend really liked the room. The bed was very comfortable and we especially liked the kitchen. Soledad was very nice, she explained all the things we had to know about Boston and she even suggested what to do. It was a great experience!"
192,"We enjoyed our stay at Mark's condo in Brookline.  It is in a great location with the Emerald Necklace right out the front door and convenient ""T"" stops.  There is everything you need (and more) in the kitchen.  There was plenty of room (square footage) for the 3 of us.  Mark's representative, Marilyn, met us as planned, explained the workings of the condo, suggested restaurants nearby and checked in to be sure all was going well during our stay.   The great communication was comforting as this was our first Air BnB experience/booking and we wondered exactly how the process would work.  We would definitely return to Mark's condo."
193,Great place especially the local neighborhood which my girlfriend and I spent a lot of time walking around. Rafael made check-in and check-out very easy! 
194,"The neighborhood is absolutely lovely. The studio is located in a quiet street right in Beacon Hill, and it is within walking distance to everything. Tiffany was very helpful in making sure everything was alright with our stay, and all the basics (towels, clean sheets, dishes, utensils, etc) were provided beforehand and already there when we arrived. The studio itself is small but practical, and perfect for a vacation stay. The wifi is not the best, but fortunately there's several signals to choose from so if one is down, you can try others. The bed is on the noisy side, and can be uncomfortable if you suffer from back problems because of the springs, but it worked out fine. If I were to stay in Boston again, I'd definitely repeat my stay here."
195,"my husband and I loved the place, everything was very neat and clean,  cozy and with a lot of privacy. location was really close to the train station and small shopping mall. very convenience. even do we didn't get to meet Hermina we spoke with her on the phone and she was very friendly and helpful. will for sure visit again. thanks Hermina "
196,"The apartment was centrally located, clean, and the transaction. Seamless. Marketa was accommodating, friendly, and a pleasure to work with."
197,"This is really fast to get downtown or to Harvard. The neighbourhood is really nice and quiet. Nevertheless we were 2 and we had to pay a  bit more for an extra person even if there was nothing to host the other person (no bed, no towel), so we had to share one small bed. The kitchen and the bathroom were not that clean."
198,"Jez and Ken have a beautiful home in Winthrop! I stayed with them for one night in mid-October and enjoyed walking around Winthrop on a gorgeous fall day. There are several local restaurants (seafood, pizza, sandwiches, etc.) within a short walk. The bedroom and bathroom are very nice and the bed was comfortable. Jez and Ken made me feel very welcome and were great hosts!"
199,"The description of the apt/condo was accurate. George left out travel brochures for us and the location of the place was amazing. We were on the 29th floor overlooking the water, 200 feet from the Boston Massacre site and the train that takes us to the airport and it was right in the middle of the Freedom Trail. The bed was very comfortable and it was a nice relief to come back and sleep after all the walking and sightseeing we did, and he left us clean towels so we didn't have to bring our own. 
Communication was outstanding. George would answer my texts within 10 minutes and was very helpful and he seemed very sincere to make sure we were comfortable and having a good time."
200,"Everything was fine. it is clean and well located so it is easy to get around from here. Everytime we had questions Lauren responded to it and gave us tips (for example where to have breakfast). She was very flexible regarding check in and check out.
I think for two it is absolutely perfect, for three it was still ok.
All in all we have nothing to complain! I recommend it.
Thanks Lauren"
201,"This is a great place to stay for convenience to Boston Airport, to enjoy the seaside, bay, beaches and lovely town of Winthrop, and for easy access in and out of central Boston/Cambridge, when you don't want the noise and rush of the city. I came in from Quebec, via Philadelphia, really late. Jez VERY KINDLY met me and brought me the few minutes back home, though a taxi would only have been a few dollars and the tube line (transit) to Orient Heights is only one stop and then a bus takes you to round the corner, or one could walk (I did both when going to and from Boston city centre). I have seldom stayed in a cleaner, more welcoming house. I was made to feel completely at home. Jez is interested and interesting and he and Ken have prepared detailed info packs for visitors to make the best use of their stays. Ken came in even later than I, after work, and yet was up for continuing to chat. Both are so nice! I loved that a wide variety of healthy options including fresh fruit were available for breakfast, I could help myself so wasn't pinned to a particular schedule. Good fresh coffee at any time and tea, too. The visit was enhanced by Winston and Oliver. Overall, I 'lived there' for my three days, rather than feeling a tourist or stranger and will definitely return. Highly recommend. "
202,"My 1st experience with an Airbnb, and it was a great introduction. An interesting, old home full of books and history in the Back Bay area of Boston. Easy to walk to interesting many interesting areas. Very easy to connect to mass transit that goes everywhere. A clean and pleasant room on top floor. Robert was welcoming and helped me get oriented to the area quickly."
203,Great Location. Good apartment. 
204,"I strongly recommend these hosts and room! I had a great time! The apartment is beautiful and welcoming. Derian, Brian and Dina are super cool and really helpful. They were very patient answering my countless rookie questions about Boston and how to use iron ;)  That being said, I must admmit that they were totally outshined by Chester The Dog. Chester rules! "
205,"I thoroughly enjoyed staying with Sarah and her son and brother. Sarah was a very gracious host. She even accommodated to my very early arrival.
I was doing some work at the convention center and I appreciated the close proximity to the bus stop."
206,"Totally awesome affordable little place to stay.  I really enjoyed staying in the area where the studio was located. It is a little off the beaten path of the main Boston sites, but the apartment is located right near the T line, and you will be downtown in ten minutes easily. It also allowed me to explore an area of Boston I would have probably not ventured out to if I knew any better. There are some great little food and bar places near by. 
The air conditioner in the room rocked! It cooled up the studio pretty quickly and I am so not use to Boston heat and humidity. The bed is comfortable. I mainly was in the room to sleep and shower and that was it., so I didn't really use anything else in the room. 
Sean was super accommodating. He met us once we arrived. Gave us some helpful tips on the area. 
Overall, great place if you are on a budget! "
207,"Enjoyed my stay at the Inn; Terry is a really great host who got everything in the room to show you the best place to be in Boston. He gives us really good advice for food, visits, etc !!!! 
The place is nice and well furnished ! I definitevely recommand this place. Thanks Terry"
208,"Amazing apartment!  We loved the comfy beds, linens, and great shower.  The view from the roof deck was absolutely breathtaking.   The only thing I would say is that if have difficulty with stairs, these are tough.  Especially after a cocktail and in high heels. :)"
209,"Amy was a great host and the room was in an wonderful location with a fantastic view on the airport of boston.
The T-Station is also not far away so it was no problem to visit all the places we want to see.
Amy was very friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our three nights at her place."
210,"This was my first Airbnb experience and Monica's place was super clean and comfy- perfect for a stopover in Boston. Proximity to airport made it super convenient and breakfast was amazing at her restaurant next door. 
Highly recommend. "
211,"Marilyn and Alan were lovely hosts. They (and their dog Jackson) made us feel welcome from the minute we walked in the door. Their house is a quick drive to Boston, which was our purpose for staying. Marilyn made the most amazing muffins for breakfast, which made the stay even more enjoyable. Marilyn and Alan's house is at the top of our list for our next Boston trip!"
212,We absolutely loved the apartment for our weekend in Boston! The location was perfect and the rooftop view was to die for! Justin was very accommodating to our travel plans and we had no issues! Would definitely recommend!!!
213,The host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
214,"A great location and Jannah couldn't be nicer. Be sure to ask her for information, advice and recommendations (great restaurant suggestions) you may need. Jannah was great about accommodating my early arrival time and other requests. In addition to a great location, Jannah is a great friend away from home."
215,"Cute small apartment, everything was great, besides the next door neighbour who sang opera during the day (haha)! The apartment was accessible to almost everything, ground transportation (bus stop and train is just 1 minute away), many restaurants nearby (Chinese, Indian, Mexican, TGI, bars), and also shops (beer/wine shop, Walgreens, 7-11). It's also near the hospital where I had my interview. One surplus that I'd like to mention about the apartment is that the water pressure was awesome, and drainage was working fine. Sean replied to my messages very fast, so I didn't have any trouble communicating with him. "
216,"Lawrence was very nice and helpful, even carrying my bag up the stairs since the building doesn't have an elevator. 
The building is in the oldest part of Boston, with a lot of history and character. You don't need a car to see all the sights since the apartment is so close and Boston is such a great walking city. 
The apartment itself needs a little work, but it is a safe and comfortable place to use for exploring Boston. There is no A/C, so take that into account when renting in hot and humid months."
217,We had a wonderful time in this Cozy Apartment. The apartment was  furnished and equipped excellently. Katherine was really helpful in getting us settled in Boston since we moved to Boston and needed to find a long-term apartment. We can only recommend to book this apartment for your stay in Boston.
218,The stay at Sarahs house war a great experience for us!! She is a very warm-hearted person and there were no problems at all! Downtown Boston can be reached by bus easily! I would always recommend it to somebody!
219,My friends and I enjoyed our stay. The apartment is nice and located in a great location with good restaurants near by. Petar was great at keeping in contact in case we needed anything. Overall it was a good stay.
220,"Really good place. Big room, good bed and plenty of space for two people. The bathroom was good and all facilities such as laundry worked. Joe himself was very pleasant. Location good - 5 to 10 minutes from the subway and felt pretty safe. Thanks for a good few days!"
221,"Kama and her friend helped us with everthing and in everyway. We would stay there again and again and again. The apartment is just like the photos, perfect and easy to get to the T system. Thank you!! 

Kama e sua amiga nos ajudaram com tudo e de todos os modos possíveis. Nós ficaríamos lá várias e várias vezes. O apartamento é exatamente como nas fotos, perfeito. Além disso é muito fácil chegar no sistema de metrô. Muito obrigada por tudo!!"
222,"I definitely recommend staying at Helen's studio if you're visiting the city for a few days. Perfect location if you're going to a game at Fenway and a short walk to other cool neighborhoods, restaurants, bars, etc. Helen was really nice, informative, and responsive during our stay. She even prepared a welcome basket of snacks and toiletries for us. "
223,"Mj's apartment is amazing and in a great location to get around Boston. Easy key hand off, and the apartment was clean and had everything we needed for our time there. Beautiful balcony overlooking the seaport area and the water. The apartment has lots of natural light so if you're trying to sleep in late it will be a bit difficult. Would book again!"
224,"Alejandra's home was absolutely lovely. My friend and I shared the AirBnB - she took the bed, which I hear was quite comfortable, and I crashed on the couch, which was immensely comfortable itself (as was the oversize chair). It's clear that she's put a ton of work into decorating the space and making it feel as comfortable as possible. Bathroom and kitchen are charming and spotless and well-appointed as well. And then there's Lily, the cat, the best roommate you could ask for - if you're a cat person, you'll be very, very glad you chose this apartment. Location was great, The South End was an area I hadn't explored in Boston before and I'm so glad I did - felt like really living in the city as opposed to holing up in a stereotypical  touristy spot. Great restaurants up on Tremont Street, easy access to cabs and public transport via Washington Street, and a cute/friendly neighborhood in between. Honestly, I give it all an unqualified recommendation. Also, Alejandra herself was a great host - friendly and perfectly communicative - it really felt like another person at the end of the texts/emails, which I think is so important. "
225,"Maria Elena went out of her way to accommodate us when snowstorm Janus hit and we weren't sure we could fly out as scheduled...She connects with her guests on a very personal level.  We love staying in the private apartment in her home.  It's in a terrific location.  Judging by how often it is rented, we can see many other people feel the same.  Thank you, Maria Elena. <a1>Hasta la próxima!"
226,"There was plenty of contact from tiffany both before and during our stay. We felt tiffany would have sorted out any problems if we had any. 
House description was spot on. 
Neighbourhood was residential and had short walks to local amenities. "
227,I chose to stay here for nearly one week. Apparently it is a nice place to stay.
228,"Our stay with Carl and his family was excellent, and if/when we return to Boston we will stay with them again. Beyond that, I will also recommend to any family or friends that are visiting Boston to stay with them, as well. The location was great - convenient walking distance to both the Green and Orange lines AND the Samuel Adams Brewery (free tours with free beer, what's not to love). The bed was very comfy, the room spacious, and they kept the place nice and warm (even putting an extra radiator in our room if needed). We never had any issues sharing the bathroom in the mornings. Carl even made us some delicious pancakes one of the mornings that we were there! If you're visiting Boston, you won't regret staying with Carl and his family. "
229,Francine and her husband was very welcoming and friendly. We could leave our luggage early in the morning in the living room. Thanks again. Everything is clean an the room is very well prepared with all you need and more. Highly recommend to stay there.
230,"The apartment is excellent: very modern, efficient, comfortable with a stunning view of the skyline and busy Boston. The only negative was the airconditioner that cut in an out like a small jet engine. The location is very good with the Metro underneath the building, and about 10 min walk to a wonderful Italian restaurant street. 

I was surprised by the formality of the booking. I had to send a several page agreement signed by my wife and I, back to Boston from Australia with very specific details about every aspect of the booking. I thought Airbnb's standard conditions did the job. Within this agreement was the stipulation that we were forgoing a $150 fee to self clean which was spelt out in minute detail once we arrived. We were happy to do this in lieu of the large fee, but it was somewhat officious, highlighted by the underlined urging for us to leave a tip for the cleaners who prepared the room for us!

Overall a very good stay, with a few niggling issues. "
231,"Rachel was a very warm and welcoming host to my two meek parents, getting them to open up over a warm and delicious breakfast! The bedroom had everything necessary to have a good night's rest, and the home was full of warmth and culture. Rachel was easy to reach via text and flexible to suit our travel needs. We would definitely stay with her again!"
232,"Great location, able to get late night good close by as well as great transit. Very helpful. :-)  classic bldg has good character. Steven was very helpful and courteous host."
233,"I became one of the long-time roommates of Jon. It is so exiting that I met another girl from my country and we became closed friends since then.some people chose to find a place in airbnb instead of staying in hotel, which can find something common between them. Perhaps, they are more eager for freedom and adventures. It was my first adventurous travelling, and I found unbelievable happiness and feeling of accomplishments from it. I knew  it maybe a beginning for the rest of life.  Jon is good guy, and I think he has a talent on arranging the things in regular in the apartment. What's more, he also has a great talent in being a scholar because of the logical preciseness. You can gain a lot from talking to him!"
234,"Nice host, nice room, nice location as usual! Highly recommend! "
235,"Joe is the epitome of a good host.  His communication was great and although we were running late, he was patiently waiting for us upon our arrival.  Joe helped us unload our things, then kindly drove around the neighborhood with me as we searched for parking.  The location of the apartment is amazing.  Nestled in a quaint and quiet little neighborhood, just a couple blocks from Bunker Hill, the place is also only a 15 minute walk or ferry ride to the lively North End.  Joe provided us with eggs, fruit, orange juice, milk, water and bagels.  I know where we'll be staying the next time we come to Boston."
236,My experience at Monique's place was outstanding! Communication was prompt and clear. Monique and her husband  were very kind and helpful -All of my needs were met. The room is immaculate and comfortable. The neighborhood is residential and peaceful. I would stay here again !
237,"Natalia's genuine warmth and incredible thoughtfulness made my stay in her cozy, personable and clean home comfortable and memorable.  

She was a beyond lovely host and is a beautiful soul.  I have an injured knee and Natalia was tremendously helpful and made sure I had what I needed while I was house ridden.

The neighborhood is one of rich character and its residents are friendly and lively.  The Ashmont T station is a 10 minute walk which makes commuting into the city very easy and accessible.

I highly recommend staying with Natalia if you desire a real local experience that's an oasis from the hustle and bustle of downtown Boston with a host who is full of passion and spirit for people and life.  "
238,"This apartment was great! It was very clean, only 1 block to a good market and 2 blocks to the subway into downtown Boston. Hermina was warm, friendly, and helpful. We would certainly stay here again."
239,"We really enjoyed our stay at Elizabeth's apartment in Brookline.  We had the place to ourselves but Elizabeth was easy to contact with questions. Her place is close to local amenities including a great traditional diner, pub, excellent bakery, handy supermarket and an independent cinema.  Within walking distance of Fenway Park and a few steps away from the nearest T line stop, it was easy to get around Boston.  The bedroom is quite small but we managed to fit everything in and the air con was very effective in the heatwave!  The rest of the apartment is beautifully decorated with art works and we made good use of the kitchen. The neighbourhood is safe and friendly so I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to couples and individual travellers. "
240,We had a great time in Boston and our stay at Tiffany's contributed to that. She's a very nice and welcoming host. She had some good suggestions for things to do and nice restaurants to eat. She always responded very quickly to our messages and was very flexible when it came to checking out (our flight was late in the evening).
241,Orchid is very easy to transact with. The apartment is in a great location and the room is clean. There are plenty of bars and places to eat around.
242,"I felt at home immediately. It's a great place to stay indeed. The home is complete with living, dining and kitchen and even a cute and private deck. Lots of beautiful art pieces and the location is serene and peaceful, yet it's within the city. Interesting restaurants around the neighborhood, and I can easily take a subway or bus to downtown or Medical Centers. Beverly has been a wonderful and generous host - you cannot ask for more! Definitely will come back to this condo, for future trips. "
243,"Amazing host, great communication! Apartment was exactly as advertised,  Brie Ana went above and beyond! "
244,The room suited what I just needed for my short 3 nights trip to Boston. Soledad was very gracious and accommodating during my whole stay. She stayed up late to wait for my arrival which was in wee hour. Soledad was very helpful and was ready to answer all my question regarding which best transportation for specific areas. The place is just 10-12 minutes walk from the T station and was just 3 minutes walk to the bus stop going to Harvard. The place was close to everything. I also did not mind walking around the area late at night because it was a safe neighborhood. If you are looking for a place that is safe and close to everything and neat/clean this is the place for you to stay. 
245,"The best thing about this apartment is John:  he is the most hospitable and thoughtful host of any airbnb my husband and I have stayed at.  He thinks of all the details and he tries to provide a hotel-quality experience for his guests.

This apartment is well suited for a single person or young/fit couple.  It is an efficient bright, renovated, nicely decorated apartment. It is cozy, but the space is well-used and John has a bright corner flat.  The two flights of walk up the stairs left us rather breathless but it was good exercise for us!

The area is certainly busy and there but you only notice the noise at night while trying to sleep.  It was hard to get a good night's sleep and it reminded me of my days living in New York City.  If you stay long enough, you would get used to it.  We also found the neighbourhood a little ""edgy"".  But it is right smack in the city and you can walk to restaurants in the area.

As you can see from the pictures, John is a talented decorator.  The apartment is beautiful and you will find all the amenities you need.

Overall, it is an excellent value for money.

246,"My stay with Pam and Sara was my first airbnb experience, and it couldn't have been more pleasant! The property is in a classic Boston neighborhood, but the many updates made it feel in many ways like a brand new home: clean, comfortable, and inviting. I travel often and I'm much like Winston Churchill when he said, 'I am easily satisfied with the very best.' The bed was sleep-inducing, the room well-appointed, and the private bathroom put it over the top. It was spacious, new, clean, and had a powerful shower. 
Pam and Sara were consummate hosts. Both were engaging and available when needed, but allowed for privacy. Their knowledge of the area is unmatched, and there were plenty of books and maps available for those times when they might not have known an area. Excellent hosts, great place, great neighborhood. I'm fearful if I say more I may not be able to stay here again as it is likely to be booked...as it should be. Don't miss it if you have the opportunity."
247,"We had a great experience staying here.  Jane could not have been any more warm, welcoming or accommodating.  She checked in with us several times before we arrived to ensure we had not run into any problems and offered to meet us somewhere so that we would not have any trouble finding the place.  We traveled to Boston to tour several colleges and found this an ideal location."
248,"Joe was very accommodating to our early check in and had the house ready upon our arrival. He was present and somewhat informative about the area. Joe has graciously stocked the fridge with eggs and milk and had also purchased bagels and bananas for us. The house is located in a charming neighborhood, easily accessible by subway and within walking distance of the Navy Yard, Cambridge and the North End. However, the experience only gets one star. The unit was dirty. The blankets and quilt were stained. The microwave had not been cleaned prior to our arrival and had food splattered about. We were not informed that the heat had been turned off and thus were unpleasantly surprised when the temperature dropped to 60 degrees during the night, with no way for us to control the temperature in the unit. "
249,"Jianmin is very friendly and helpful. He is a really good host. 
The room is big with a queen sized bed (140x200cm), a fridge, a couch and your own bath with direct connection to the room. However the last persons stay was still visible and you do not get any light from outside as the 4-5 windows have closed blinds which you cannot reach through the plastic warp over the window.  The room itself is in a beautiful and old house (unfortunately a lot of things are just everywhere standing around).  
In the morning you get breakfast with coffee, orange juice, fruits, toats, oatmeal etc. and you can go outside into a really beautiful area with old buildings and trees. To get to Boston is a little more problematic but if you have a car or bike you can get in 15 mins (car) to the train station ""Chestnut Hill""  where you can park for free."
250,Awesome location. Great room with plenty of space. 
251,We LOVED it. The house/room is very nice and lovely. Mary and Barney are friendly and helpful hosts that answered all our questions very quickly. The house was in a great location and a short walk to the train. We 100% recommend the Carneyfamily house!!
252,"Very good location in South End.
Rafael was available. "
253,"We just got back from our trip to Boston and could not have been more pleased with our stay in Tiffany's home. Her home is beautiful and clean with modern décor and a welcoming feel. Tiffany provided all the amenities that we could possibly need which made packing much easier for us. The kitchen was stocked with snacks and a bottle of wine for us to enjoy. The beds were extremely comfortable and we had more than enough pillows and blankets. Tiffany provided us with plenty of towels, toiletries, a hair dryer, and we were able to use her washer and dryer. The location was within walking distance to several shops and restaurants and about a 10 minute walk to the subway. Overall, Tiffany was an exceptional host and I would highly recommend staying in her home. "
254,It was everything we need! Thanks for the great stay ;)
255,"Great neighborhood, love staying in the South End.  For anyone thinking about visiting it is a great location to stay that will allow you to easily get around.

Great info about the unit was provided in advance of our stay, including transportation and restaurant recommendations.

Property Manager met us at the unit on our arrival to give tour, keys, and answer questions."
256,The location is perfect but it is a 4th floor walk up with only a/c in the sleeping nook.....it needs a little elbow grease to give it a nice clean shine. Bed needs a new comforter and some new pillows. It served its purpose but if the weather was any hotter it would be a little unbearable to hangout it the apartment.
257,"Phyllis is a superb hostess... super friendly, super helpful, super fine.  Phyllis went above and beyond to help me with the results of a car accident to with a morning drive downtown to the convention that my husband was attending.  The breakfasts were delicious and the room was very comfortable.  we highly recommend Back Bay.

The location is just off Mass Pike, a five minute walk to the Charles River, and close to Harvard.  "
258,Great place and James is a nice guy. Very beautiful and quiet area south of Boston.
259,I would like to thank Beatrice for a good time in her house. The neighborhood is good the same as the house. Beatrice is a good host and she helped us a lot in this trip.  
260,Our stay at the Roost was exactly what we wanted. Jamaica Plains is charming and its easy to get to Boston with public transportation. We stayed in the Fox room that was very nice and clean. Recommended!
261,Helpful host. Apartment in good location.
262,"We spent 4 nights here in late September before taking the train to New York. The apartment location is amazing. Located on a quaint street lined with brownstones. At the end of the block is a walking bridge over to the Charles riverside park and paths. Also at the end of the block is a bike rental station. We ran and walked along the river and went all over the city without hardly ever taking a cab. Boston is vey accessible. Also just a 5 minute walk is Charles street at the bottom of Beacon hill lined with restaurants and a great market, and in the other direction is the famous Newbury street. The apartment was lovely and comfortable. We will definitely be back. Thanks Nicole!"
263,"We really had a great time in Gerard and Marie's apartment. The neighborhood is lovely and we enjoyed their restaurant tips, especially the old tavern. Boston is an interesting town to visit and well connected to other places of interest. But, most importantly, Gerard and Marie were friendly and helpful hosts and the apartment nice, cozy, clean, with everything we needed. Definitely recommended."
264,"Sarah is a very friendly, welcoming, smiling host. She left me to 'do my own thing' but was helpful when needed. The room was lovely! Transport to downtown Boston is very close."
265,"Afiyah was so great, very layed back, and showed us around her home.
Wonderful bedroom, and the location is perfect, next to the airport.
She also had breakfast all set up, and we could come and go as we pleased.
I would highly recommend their home!"
266,"Tyree is a super friendly, welcoming host! The studio is really nice, we've got everything that we could possibly need and lots of kitchen stuff more! She saved our breakfast by having milk and water in the fridge for us :-) 
For fellow travellers: Getting around in Boston - for us the easiest way was with bus and bike! (hubway) Driving is ok, but parking downtown is a real task!
Thanks again Tyree for a lovely stay!"
267,This is a great location! Plenty of parkings available and it was clean! The house is spacious and Curtis was very helpful with our late check in. 
268,Tell others in the Airbnb community about your stay.
269,"The Wirth's were great hosts and the Studio apartment was very well equipped for our stay in the Boston Area.  It is a very convenient location, within walking distance of the ""T"" and several local shops.  We hope it will be available when we return to Boston as we would stay there again!"
270,If you need a place close to the airport to crash just for a night it is a good location. The A/C only worked in the larger BR but after talking to Shawn about this he reduced our rate and was very easy to work with.
271,We felt very welcome and our stay was equally pleasant. 
272,"Me and my girlfriend stayed at Owen<b4>s apartment for almost a week, and loved it. It stays in a great Boston neighborhood, surrounded by italian restaurants and Oyster bars.  In addition, Owen left us chalk boards with his favourite restaurants around, and directions to the nearest CVS and the subway. The pictures are ""for real"", and the apartment is big and comfy. Nice bedroom, nice bathroom , plenty of space. Highly recommended!"
273,"Amazing stay at a wonderfully appointed, two-story apartment within walking distance to many of the more historic attractions Boston has to offer.  Ed couldn't have been a more generous host and our experience couldn't have been better. "
274,"We stayed at Helens place in JP mid July 2015.We want to thank Helen for her warm hospitality during our stay.The charming house fulfilled all our expectations, nestled in a tree-lined suburb close to shops, parks and the train station. The surprise daily breakfast treats of croissants and muffins, along with fresh fruit and the coffee maker made our stay even more satifying.We would recommend Helens place, to any (website hidden) is exactly like it is on site."
275,"Reserving and getting to the apartment were easy.  At first we had the wrong code in our email for the front door but there was a friendly person at the other end of their phone line who helped us even at 10pm! The apartment was great - nice location, stylish furnishings, clean. We would definitely rent again through Seamless Transition."
276,"Hermina was a very gracious and fun host.  She was helpful but not at all intrusive.  She was even kind enough to drive me to a car rental agency!  Her house is nice and in a great location (T stop is two blocks away, police station is behind her house so we always felt very safe).  Overall, a great experience. "
277,"Terry proved to be an ideal host. He was warm and immediately made us feel comfortable and welcome. The location was very good for our needs and was centrally located to many facilities and entertainment. The room and common areas were immaculate and well maintained. Terry was focused on our comfort in his home and in the area. If all Airbnb were this good I would not stay anywhere else. We left not only feeling like we had received good value, but like we found a new friend."
278,"The house is fantastic, very clean and comfortable.  Furnished nicely and the kitchen is set-up to use/cook in.  John is very responsive and organized (provides all the information needed for the house in one message).  The  location is very nice.  It is on a quiet street, next to some restaurants that are walkable or a few minutes away by car.  The grocery store is a few blocks away and the commuter T station is a couple of blocks away."
279,"Benjamin, the host, was very helpful and friendly. We was very prompt to respond to our resquests. The neighborhood was authentic, full of restaurants, and very close from the city, about 10 minutes from the door of the apartment to the center of Boston (by taking the subway). The apartment is very basic and feel a little like a student place. It's very clean but a little sketchy. It's in a semi basement with a little outside patio and without opening windows. Everything you need for your stay is present but it's really basic. It's an ok place to sleep but not to hangout for a rainy day. Overall, OK experience, OK price if you compare to the other places in Boston, Good localisation and Excellent host."
280,"The room and home were exactly as listed- exceptionally clean and welcoming. Carolyn was a fantastic host, going out of her way to make sure we had a lovely stay. "
281,"This location was perfect for our visit.  Sean was very accommodating with our early arrival.  The apartment had everything that we needed for our weekend stay.  My daughter thought the pull-out bed was very comfortable as well.  He was responsive to our communication before, during and after our stays.  And - his kids are adorable! ;)"
282,"Sally and Bruce were very friendly. Sally gave us lots of directions and additionally they left in our bedroon many brochures and a guide with information about Boston. They answered anything we asked and also recommended places to eat in the neighborhood. They also lent us a Charlie card so that the trips by bus and metro were cheaper. The bedroom was clean and we had access to the kitchen and the rest of the house. If you're looking for a place near the city centre, maybe this is not best right location, but if you're looking for a nice and friendly stay, then this is the right place. 
Special mention should also be made about Darwin, the house cat, who basically is the boss!."
283,"We really enjoyed our stay. The place was clean, quiet, spacious, with natural light and very well located. The host was easy to contact, polite and answered all of our questions. Highly recommended."
284,The room was big and nice. Everything was clean and it worked smoothly. We had a very nice stay. 
285,"The room is good value, basic but has all that is needed and is clean. The check-in is well organised and the host was easy to contact. The area is a suburb, but the blue T line gets you downtown quickly, with only few stops. I felt safe and the area has cheerful shops and restaurants with food from around the world. If I am again in Boston and require budget accommodation, I would love to be your guest again. Highly recommend."
286,"I enjoyed my stay. The location was great, the room very clean and comfortable. Very friendly hosts!"
287,"We had a fantastic stay in Boston in this house.  The house was lovely, the neighbourhood nice, there were convenient restaurants / food shops close by and to get downtown it was only a couple of stops on the red line.  Tiffany<80><99>s guest guide had everything we needed and throughout the booking / stay she was great."
288,Gustavo was very good and quick at communicating with me which helped the experience.  Upon arrival there were a couple of miscues out of Gustavo's hands that he tried to remedy quickly.  The location was great and easily within walking distance to the Fenway area and the roommates were all quiet and accommodating.
289,The reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
290,Beautiful apartment with a perfect location. 
291,"This place is in a great location, walking distance to Fenway and the Museum of Fine Arts, as well as close to the T to get to other areas of the city. 

Jimi was responsive via email and gave really clear instructions on how to access the building, park, etc. "
292,"nice district and nice house. It's a bit far from the center but you can quickly get into Boston any time. Jeff is very kind, I would recomend him and his apartment. We had a nice time here! Thanks"
293,"Marian quickly responded all of my questions prior to my visit to Boston for the marathon and wished me good luck in the race! She went out of her way to ensure the house was prepared for my family's visit and left two contact numbers to call if we needed anything. Jamaica Plain is a little outside of the city, but Marian's house is not terribly far from a T station, which was perfect for commuting into Boston. My family felt like we were staying in a home away from home and are grateful for everything Marian did to make our stay as nice as possible."
294,"Sophia was a great host, everything was as described and she gave us a lot of privacy. She was also accessible if we needed anything. She left great notes on where to go in Boston and around her neighborhood."
295,"Ravi was a great host -- was very flexible with my arrival time (I changed it almost three times) and super nice. He even accidentally left with the room keys and quickly ran back to give them to me. The listing looks just like the photos and is in a great location. The proximity to the airport (a 10 minute drive) and to restaurants/shopping on Newbury is worth the price.

"
296,"Really lovely room is the most amazing house! Robert and Jackie were full of helpful information and suggestions, the location is wonderful (walking distance to practically everything!) and I wish I'd been able to stay longer."
297,"Our stay with Will at this apartment was very pleasant. It was clean and had plenty of space for our group of 6.  All of the appliances and kitchen-ware was updated and awesome. Everything was clean upon our arrival, and we had essentially everything we needed. Internet was fast."
298,"The apartmet is very well located, few minutes to the most famous places in Boston. There is also a T Station and buses stops lines, so you can go everywhere in town quickly. Kim is so kind and helpful. We had a great time there. The neighbourhood is very safe and you can find shops, markets, restaurants, pharmacies and wahtever you need near you.
Definitely recommend this one."
299,"No fuss stay in a great area with very convenient access to transit.

This particular space is huge--has a queen bed and king bed and small couch. Could sleep lots of people. 

There are several rooms in this house, but each has its own lock. With 2.5 bathrooms and a miniature sort of kitchen area downstairs (fridge/microwave), so not too much competition for these things.

For the money, you probably won't get more space with less fuss."
300,Really good stay in a clean nice house
301,"My partner and our sixteen-year-old daughter had a magnificent stay at the Carney's Harbor View.  Fabulous location, spotless bathrooms, a welcoming home with lots of space for socializing, privacy for sleeping, as well as fresh coffee and muffins in the morning. All aspects were beyond expectation and delightful hosts to boot make this AirBnB a top experience.  I know we will tell everyone we know going to Boston that this is the place to stay!"
302,"Peter was a great host. The apartment is clean and very cozy. We loved the location, we walked pretty much everywhere. But the subway is close, if you need it. The apartment could use a few more ""essentials"" but other than that, it's a great place to stay."
303,It's a nice clean place. Mr Taskin is very nice and helpful. The guest though right next door was so loud and at 3-4am. Otherwise it's was good place and I would come back again. 
304,"I only stayed one night; however, the house was nice, secure (always locked, stuff felt safe), community around the house is down to earth--I highly recommend the pizza place just down the street. House feels warm and homelike, the T is just a couple minute walk away and thus making where you stay central to anywhere you want to go!! Hermina was gone while I was there, but she put me in contact with her friend who was very kind and wanted to make sure I had a good time while there. One night is not enough to enjoy all that Boston has to offer, not by far... so I plan on coming back very soon and plan on making this where I will stay."
305,"Elegant two-level apartment located in beautiful neighborhood close to attractions, restaurants and shops, as well as public transport.
Unique interior decoration with original artwork pieces, yet conveniently furnished to be a comfortable home. Being there for work, I regret I did not enjoy more the outside private deck than just picking the cherry tomatoes and herbs!
Beverly is very caring and did her best to warmly welcome me. She surely made me feel at home and was very responsive whenever I had issues, it was even like having my mother living right upstairs."
306,Brandon is a perfect host. His house is so clean and the room is perfect. House is close to the T line. I highly recommend this place and if I ever go to Boston again I will definitely stay here.
307," The place was great, great location. Will definitely book this place in the future! Beautiful apartment and spacious; David is a very accommodating host."
308,Had a really good experience. The house was in the ideal location for Boston and found the whole rental to be very easy. Would recommend! 
309,"This is a wonderful apartment, in a great location. I travel to Boston regularly for business and my normal hotel was booked - as were most of the hotels in the area. Yoshikas<80><99> apartment was an excellent alternative, and far more comfortable than a hotel.

Although I only stayed 3 nights, but would have been comfortable for a much longer stay. The apartments amenities were ver good, and made for a relaxing and enjoyable trip.

Thanks again Yoshika!"
310,"Angela's place was just as the previews reviews have stated. Great location, extremely clean and a great place to stay. Angela was a terrific host who always made sure I had everything I needed and provided me with plenty of sightseeing and food suggestions. Her dog Nevada is extremely well behaved and great company.
"
311,"The location of the flat is well described, it's right on Beacon Hill, nearby everything. There's a Whole Foods, the Common Park, Charles St, etc.
We got there 2 hours after the check-in, but the room had not been cleaned yet. Christopher quickly made sure that someone was coming to clean up. The parking is impossible on Beacon Hill, that would have been nice to know before, it's a small tip on the neighbourhood but pretty useful. The AC is located in the bathroom, behind the door. We turned it off because it was either blocked by the door or only cooling the bathroom. 
I would say the flat is nice, a little smaller than what I expected. It is cozy for a couple of days, but I wouldn't stay there longer."
312,"All good, clean, comfortable and nice walking access to Boston.  Bedroom is accessed from landing, dedicated bath is also a door on same landing, so a quick step from bedroom to bath.  Luxurious bathrobes and nice continental breakfast both a surprise."
313,"Antoinette & Louis were perfect hosts, welcoming and nothing too much trouble.  Description of house, room, and neighbourhood were accurate, and all were excellent. It was the best Air BandB accommodation we have found, and we recommend it very highly.  It is out of the City Centre, but we found the 10 minute walk to the T Line interesting and safe even late in the evening. We find that to stay in a 'proper neighbourhood' and trip in and out of City sights is for us the most enjoyable way."
314,"This room is one of multiple units that the owner has and rents through a different company with listings on airbnb, it's not a typical airbnb listing; Brent doesn't live here, nor does he live in the same building. 

This being said, it was still a great choice for Boston. The check-in process is very simple; they send you an email with the code for the front door, and the code for your unit. My girlfriend and I arrived, opened the front door, found our unit, and got in. That's it. Overall very simple, very easy. 

The unit was not the one pictured in the listing, but it was basically the same. (Different carpet color, furniture arrangement, etc.). It was quite small, but good enough for two people in Boston.

The room itself: clean, well appointed, but bring some toiletries if you plan on staying for a few days, as they only had one travel sized bottle of shampoo. There is a laundry room in the basement, with two washers, and two dryers that are free, but bring your own detergent. Best part of the listing was the fantastic location. Very handsome brownstone building in an old part of town with similar brownstones and only a five minute walk to Copley Square; Fantastic! If you don't mind the small size and the fact that your renting from a company, this is a fantastic choice. We had a great time. "
315,"Great stay here in Boston. The room is small but quirky, and the double bed on the floor is comfortable. I liked the decor and felt like an architect for a night. The room is a steal especially for a weekend, would definitely come here again."
316,"From beginning to the end Jazz made us feel very much at home. The apartment is located in a highly accessible part of the city with easy access to many landmarks and mass transit stations. As described, the room is well maintained, the apartment is contemporary and clean and the host did an amazing job making us feel welcomed. "
317,"Robert was a great host, really kind person and he knows everything  you need to know about Boston!

Beautiful-old-typical-Boston house, in a great (email hidden)st of the tourist spots are less than 20 minutes by walking, 3 minutes walking from Back Bay station..what else?

I got a bigger room than the one expected, lot of space (probably the only one without book :p), it was clean and comfortable, same for the bathroom. I stayed only one night but it would have been perfect for a week too.

Nothing else to add, I really recommend Robert's place!"
318,"Catherine was great, super thorough.  Her houseboat was very charming.  We would totally stay there again, and recommend her spot to anyone traveling to Boston."
319,"Robert and his staff are very friendly. Also the location is perfect. The room is old but clean and comfortable. If there were some paper cups in the room, it will be helpful."
320,"The Zhang family made my first experience with AirBNB amazing ! They did more than make us feel at home , they were the definition of a true host. Met us at the front door and immediatly sat us down and offered us drinks. We arrived later than expected but there was no issue . The rooms offered were decorated and cozy, and te bathroom had all necessities ! They even had options for what to eat for breakfast. I couldn't be more pleased with our stay here . We hope to see them again soon! "
321,"Beautiful, stylish and spacious apartment in a great part of Boston. Very close to key attractions and within easy walking distance to nice restaurants, cafes and also the subway station. Apartment was super clean and had everything you needed for a great stay. Xerxes was very quick to respond to enquiries and getting into the property on arrival was easy to arrange. Wanted to stay longer!!!"
322,"Soledad was an excellent host. The property was very clean and in a very nice and convenient neighbourhood.

She was also very accommodating and went out of her way to help us with food recommendations, and even went out to get some extra first aid materials as I had injured my foot.

Overall, a very good option for your stay in Boston, and I would stay there again! Thanks Soledad!"
323,"A quiet mini flat with a private entrance, off street parking, public transport and village style dining nearby. Close to MIT, Harvard, Boston College and Boston University and the CBD is only 30 mins away. A real gem in such a busy city.
Hosts Deepti and Michael are engaging and helpful. They are available if required but leave you to your own space.
I had two stays separated by a long weekend. 
Perfect after a 24 hr trip from Australia."
324,"Even only for one night, we had a really nice stay at Carney's house. Everything was really tidy and clean. Bathroom, even if shared, was amazing. And in the morning we had everything for breakfast too, fresh and delicious handmade muffins included. Mary is lovely and available for any kind of questions.
I warmly recommend Carney Family house."
325,"I just stayed at Kim's adorable apartment for 4 days. Kim was a great host, as everyone else has said. She responds to questions quickly and made my whole trip a lot easier. The location of the apartment is in walking distance to tons of great stuff. It's a true Boston experience!"
326,James and Sam had a brilliant time in Boston. They loved the house and felt extremely relaxed and comfortable during their stay! The close proximity to the convention centre was a massive plus.
327,The cottage was very cozy. It's at a convenient yet reclusive location. My favorite part was the dining booth that looks out to the back yard.
328,"Rosales was an excellent host! Very helpful once I had booked with her, providing detailed and prompt answers to all my questions. Staying with her was very comfortable and she went out of her way to ensure that I had everything I needed including medicine for a cold. I'd definitely stay with her were I to visit Boston again. Thank you!"
329,The apartment was very nice and very well equipped with all the cooking things you could want and even food staples available to use!   The neighborhood was nice and the apartment was very quiet.
330,"Bernie was a gracious host and very detailed with my accommodations and the area. The room was clean and had everything anyone could need while away from home. The views were indeed lovely, wish I had more time to spend on the roof! Bernie was great in communicating everything and setting everything up. "
331,Fabulous location and arranging with the owners was seamless and easy. The apt was spotless and the bed is really comfortable.  The only thing to be aware of is that the apt is first floor in an alley and I wasn't comfortable leaving blinds/windows open so it's pretty dark feeling - but we weren't there much and I would certainly recommend it.
332,"The location was great, the apartment was cozy, and the mattress was pretty comfortable. 

The lock was a bit tricky at first..but the directions were clear in how to get it opened.  Parking was an issue but we used a nearby garage on Somerset for $37 a day.

I would give my experience a 3.5 out of 5.  - 1 star because the bed slats were broken, fell off the frame twice, and scared the crap out of us in the middle of the night.  Another -.5 star because there were dirty dishes in the sink  when I got there, which I ended up cleaning myself."
333,"The Carney Family has a beautiful home, offer fresh muffins and coffee in the morning and made us feel like family friends in for a visit. The room was large and bright and the bed was comfy. The house is a short walk to the red line T, which basically connects you to the major sights in Boston. We loved our stay! "
334,Erin & Jd were lovely hosts the house was in a nice quiet neighbourhood and the bus to Kenmore station which was essential for the greenline subway which gets you everywhere you need to go the dogs were great and well behaved and lexi loves ball games it was a brilliant finish to our 3 month tour of the states and if we go to Boston again we will certainly look Erin up
335,Fantastic experience. Rooftop patio was awesome. Short walk to convention center and waterfront area.
336,"Thanks to Luis for helping to make our stay in Boston great! The six days flew by and were filled with activity so it was a relief to have such a convenient location to come back to each night. The apartment is a short walk to the nearest T station, grocery market, Fenway Park, and the restaurants/bars surrounding the park. Luis was very flexible with the check-in and check-out times too which was helpful as our flights were at odd times. "
337,"Lovely apartment in a great location in Boston, within walking distance of the Prudential Center and Fenway Park. Everything was clean and the place was kitted out with everything you need for a short stay.

Excellent communication from Will, he responded to all my advance queries and ensured we had all the required information. 

Highly recommended. Thanks!"
338,"Sean's place is in an excellent location, right on Beacon Hill and easy distances to everything. The place itself was pretty basic and spartan, nothing fancy, but we were only there a night and weren't really using it for more than sleeping, so it worked well enough for us."
339,"Our stay at Gustavo's place was amazing. We'll absolutely be back.

- Location: The location is perfect. In the heart of Boston and walking distance from Back Bay Station. We walked everywhere from here without any problems.

- Stay: The room is very cozy, clean and comfortable. Gustavo will provide necessities and it has wi-fi, so basically you don't need more than that. Also, breakfast is included which is quite nice.

Although bathrooms are shared by 2 rooms we didn't actually experienced that, so even better, but that might put off some people

- Host: Gustavo is a really nice, polite and helpful guy. It's been a pleasure to stay with him. "
340,"Gillian's place was amazing and clean, and it was really conveniently located. She was also very hospitable and friendly, and accommodating to our plans. We will definitely recommend her place to others. We had a wonderful time in Boston thanks to her! :)  "
341,"The host was very gracious and able to call and help me with my arrival despite being in China at the time ! Its not his fault, but the cold draft of the windows made it tough to sleep. The place was well put together and the needs were met for staying. I appreciated the access to WiFi and TV.  I was very happy and satisfied and would definitely stay there again. "
342,Damon's place is cozy and in a great location! It's very close to downtown Boston and within walking distance to several restaurants and stores. The added bonus is that my girls loved staying in the bunk bed and all of the kid's toys. Damon was also very responsive with all of my questions. We would definitely stay here again!
343,"Perfect! the location of Kim's place was fantastic. Just around the corner from the Boston Public Library, Trinity Church, shopping on Newbury, the Green line T... the list goes on.

The apartment was clean and quiet and Kim went well beyond the minimal requirements, providing food and drink, towels, bathrobes, amenities and more to make the stay feel like home.

I will definitely stay here again when visiting Boston."
344,"I stayed with Duane while on a two-month clinical rotation and his living arrangement fit my needs perfectly. Duane's place is pretty much exactly how his description on here says. He is very quick to share information about goings-on around Boston and is very knowledgeable of the surrounding area and getting around. He will bend over backwards to make your stay a welcome one and even throws in a never-ending supply of freshly baked bread to boot! The neighborhood is nice and quiet and very culturally diverse. There are a few bus routes that routinely stop by at nearby locations that can take you to the Forest Hills train stop. Duane can give you more information about the routes to and from Roslindale and may even assist you in getting around as he did with me a few times. I highly recommend at least contacting him and seeing if he's the right fit for your stay in Boston, but be quick because it appears that he has quite a popular place!"
345,Great place in a great spot.  Very clean and well furnished for our family of six.  Entry instructions were easy to follow.  
346,"My business partner, Lynn, and I stayed with Bill during a 6 day conference we were attending at the Boston Convention and Expo center; while I had some reservations about what it would be like to commute back and forth to our conference from Dorchester we opted to stay with Bill because it was so much more affordable than the $250-$500 hotel rooms near the convention center.
What I discovered was that my stay in Boston was so much more enjoyable because of our commute, as well as because of the wonderful host that Bill was. Public transportation in Boston is easy and very safe and I  got a true feel for life in Boston because I had an opportunity ""live"" like the locals.
Bills place is lovely and very, very comfortable, but more than anything he is an amazing host; generous, kind, accommodating and helpful beyond words.
I was initially a bit concerned about what it might be like to share a space with a host; in the past when I had used airbnb I always rented a space of my own (I am the type of person who values my own space and privacy). But I have to say that it was a wonderful experience and to anyone who is concerned about this I would say that you have no need to worry if you are coming to town to stay with Bill.
He was totally respectful of our privacy while making himself available to us when we needed anything at all. 
Also, my business partner became very ill soon after we arrived and so she had to return home; which left me alone with my host. And again, while this may have normally been a concern (sharing a house with a man who is a total stranger to me) once again, I can only say that being with Bill was nothing less than a perfect experience.
He was always there to offer advice when needed, he was beyond generous in offering lifts to and from the train, airport, supermarket, access to laundry, coffee, snacks and room in the fridg for my own food. The list goes on.....
If I am ever back in Boston I look forward to staying with Bill again!"
347,"Irina was great, made my daughter and me feel very welcome.  The neighborhood was awesome and the experience was accurately represented on the website.  I would stay here again if possible next time I come to Boston."
348,My colleague stayed at Robert's place. It was in a very nice neighbourhood and a close walk to the conference we were attending. Robert greeted us and made sure my colleague had a comfortable stay! 
349,"My mom and I visited Boston and had the pleasure of staying at Andrew's apartment. This AirBnB experience was the best and most professional AirBnB experience I've ever had. Andrew and his girlfriend, Julia, were prompt, welcoming, and really just had it together. The apartment was centrally located, beautifully decorated, and very comfortable. We really couldn't have found a better place to stay! My mom and I were very impressed with both the accommodation and the professionalism of our stay. "
350,"Neither Ben or his assistant Corey were able to meet us, as we were severely delayed by train from Philly. However, Corey was very helpful over the phone, and made sure we had no problems accessing the apartment. The place is clean and in decent shape, but feels more like budget motel than an airbnb experience. "
351,"Mary Kate gave us excellent directions to the apartment, and she even stayed to greet us, despite our flight being delayed. She was immediately welcoming and told us the essentials, including some great tips about the neighbourhood. The apartment suited our needs and was just like it is in the photos, and Mary Kate was kind enough to leave us fruit, water and coffee/tea. The only negatives we found were the lack of a toaster/grill - with us not being the kind to have cooked breakfasts every day, this left us with just cereal. You also hear a lot of noise from people walking around in the apartment above, and we noticed people using the washing machine at 11.30pm which is just outside the apartment's back door so you can hear it quite loudly! 

Jamaica Plains is a very quiet neighbourhood, and if I'm honest, perhaps a little too quiet for what we wanted. That being said we had one of our best meals on the holiday at Tres Gatos, a brilliant tapas bar (where you must order the tortilla!) which is about a 15 minute walk away, thanks again to Mary Kate for recommending it. Whole Foods and the main shops are a good 15-20 min walk, and there's City Feed, a great little shop where you can pick up essentials and more about 5/10 mins away. Don't use the corner shop at the end of the road - we went once and everything we bought was out of date!! There are some great places at the local brewery, but unless we had been told about it we probably would have missed it! Jamaica Plains is a lovely quiet place to stay, but remember it is about 15-20 mins on the subway into downtown Boston which can become a bit tiresome when you have to make that journey over and over again. Having the subway station a mere 2 minute walk from the apartment is fantastic, though you can also hear it there too, but it didn't bother us too much. 

We had a great time in Boston, and Mary Kate and Javier's apartment served us well, and is exactly as described. I'd definitely recommend it if you're after a quiet place away from the bustle of the city. "
352,"initially, it took several different AirBnB requests (and then denials from other advertised units), before we requested George's unit. a
George communicated with us on our needs and he worked his schedule and kindly accommodated us.
The apartment is as advertised. In fact it seemed larger than what I expected. 
We did not have a car (arrived by air). The apartment is well located for mass transit (a bus stop is directly across the street, runs every 20 min, then 5 or so minutes to Broadway Station and RED Line Subway connection). so was easy breezy to get around Boston.
There is good security and good elevator system. We felt very safe there. 
There is a grocery store about 10 minute walk away.
There are good family run cafes / restaurants just walking close by. We enjoyed the 'Hidden Kitchen' sandwich shop just across the street.  
I am very picky on noise levels, and even tho the apartment is near a major highway/busy street. The noise level did not bother me either during the day or night.    
We liked the nice modern kitchen, good WIFI and a TV system with lots of choices. 

 "
353,"Ari was a very hospitable host.   He was very helpful in getting us oriented to Boston.  He was friendly but not intrusive. The location is great!  It is just around the corner from the bus and a short walk from the train/subway. Thanks Ari, for a wonderful week."
354,"The place is well located; easy access to metro, Fenway, stores and dining . The bed was really comfortable."
355,"My stay was quiet and comfortable, with no issues that make it the slightest bit un-recommendable.   Great little desk, hanger, lights, 4 windows, bed and little heater to adjust my own weather if I so desired. 

"
356,Juliet was very friendly and accommodating. The house was just as described and suited our families stay nicely. The house was very clean and in good order. We only stayed one night but Juliet directed us to a very nice local cafe for breakfast in the morning and the house was close enough to downtown Boston to make it convenient. 
357,"Three friends and I had a great experience staying in Nancy's apartment. Nancy was very friendly and accommodating, and even gave us a quick tour of the city while giving us a ride to the apartment. She communicates promptly and provided us with suggestions on how to spend our few days in Boston. 

The apartment is in a great area within reasonable walking distance of many of Boston's main attractions. It is simple yet clean, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.  "
358,"The experience that my girlfriend and I had with the whole Airbnb process through Amy amazing. Amy sent us the keys along with a very helpful (and informative) sheet with not only details about the property, but also some great tips about the Beacon Hill area. The apartment was very clean, organized, cozy, and welcoming. Amy recommended a nearby parking garage (that did have cheaper weekend rates), so it was great not having to move the car during our entire stay. Having a private balcony (along with rooftop access) was remarkable, especially since the weather held out pretty well, so we could enjoy a few beers in the sun. The apartment was only about a 7-10 minute walk to the music festival that we were seeing, which was even better. It was also centrally located so that we could walk to the Back Bay area with some great shopping. Very quaint area (Beacon Hill) with some amazing buildings and architecture. We felt safe in the apartment, as well as the neighborhood. We absolutely loved staying here (as also having the convenience of a full kitchen was very handy) and we look forward to staying again. We highly recommend this listing! Cheers! "
359,"Right smack dab in the middle of Historic Beacon Hill. Parked the car in the Boston Commons garage and never once needed it for 4 days.  Everything is walk-able.  Excellent restaurants throughout the neighborhood. 
We texted Larry when we were a 1/2 hour out, and he met us at the door.  He's quick to respond to any texts.  
"
360,"The appartment was spacious and clean. There's one bedroom, a bathroom and a livingroom with a small kitchenette all for yourself. Unfortunately the fridge was not working during our stay but Evy was trying to resolve this issue. With 2 large beds and 1 small bed therevis enough space for 5 persons.
Communicaton with Evy was good and the tips she gave were a great help. We enjoyed our stay in Boston and the appartment."
361,"This listing is right on! Communication was clear and getting in and out was fast and simple. Laura is friendly and accommodating. We walked every where from this excellent location. Everything we could possibly need or want was within easy reach! The apartment is cozy, clean and comfortable. 
It is a little small for four adults if you were going to spend a large amount of time in the apartment itself. Perfect size for the two of us. The third story offers a great view to the street and the back balcony off the bedroom offered a private little alcove to drink our morning coffee and get organized for the day ahead. We give this place an easy two thumbs up!"
362,"Tam was a great host.  Picking up the keys was easy and the building is gorgeous.  Fort Point is a hip area of Boston, and the condo is right in the middle of it.

Tam was responsive and easy-going.  I would highly recommend renting his condo.
"
363,"Steven was great, he was very friendly and accommodating. He came by when we checked in to answer all of our questions. The house was very clean and had plethora if amenities. Everyone who stayed there is planning to stay again when we travel to Boston again. The parking was also really easy."
364,"I decided on very short notice to stay in Charleston to visit a friend for a couple of days. Rosalia was quick to respond and very easy going. When I arrived, Rosalia was very welcoming and we talked about this and that. Overall, the stay was a very pleasant experience and the apartment and room were clean, just as I expected after reading all the positive previous reviews. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Charleston. "
365,"This was a great place to stay while visiting the Boston area. The location is great with easy public transit and freeway access. Afiyah was great at communicating before and during my stay. Afiyah was great at giving directions to the house by many different means of transportation. Afiyah gave great recommendations as a local of places to visit while in town. The house was very clean, quiet and charming. The breakfast was great to get the day started off right for a day of exploring or meetings. Afiyah was very understanding about about leaving my luggage at the house while I explored the town and had a late flight. Would highly recommend staying here to family, friends, or anybody that is looking for a room in Boston!!!!!"
366,"We had a very pleasant stay with Molly and Ben.  The bedroom was large and comfortable and our bathroom was well-equipped with everything we needed.  Our hosts were laid back and friendly and had good advice on places to visit.  The apartment was just as we imagined it from the photos and the area, East Boston, was very convenient for the airport and for transport links into the city.  It felt very safe walking around in the evening and there were a number of good restaurants and bars within walking distance.  We will definitely use AirBnB again."
367,"Joe's place was great!  The location was perfect.  Charlestown is a perfect location.  Taking the ferry to downtown was a real delight.  Joe was incredibly helpful and accommodating.  I would whole heartedly recommend staying with Joe.

Enjoy!"
368,"This place looked exactly as in the pictures. It's true that it is a basement suit but I heard very little noise from above. It was clean, the bed was comfortable, and there were all of the amenities one needs when living (and cooking) away from home. The location was great. Key pickup and drop off was simple and easy. I'd recommend it for a simple uncomplicated easy stay in the city. "
369,Tiffany is a grad host. She answers every question and tries to help. The place is awesome. Great location and close to the historic sights. Almost everything is in walking distance. I loved the area of Beacon Hill and would always stay here again. The bathrooms were always clean and I barely saw anybody else. I definitely recommend to stay here. 
370,"This accomodation is lovely, very cosy and fitted with evrything you need. Soledad and Rodrigo have been very nice and easy-going and Ieft his place with a little tear in my eye. It was a great time in Boston and this place was perfect for my trip!
Thank you very much!"
371,"Great Location, well equipped.  Close to T station.  Great experience.  "
372,"It's impossible to find a place like this in Boston!!!

Corey is very warm and hospitable. She is very kind and responded within minutes after I send her a message. She's very easy to talk to and even baked the most yummy banana muffins for us. The location of the apartment is very nice. You can actually see the Bunker Hill monument when you walk out of the compound. We loved the private entrance and backyard as well as preparing meals in the fully utilizable kitchen. The neighborhood is quiet and there is a washing machine and dryer in the flat. We had a really great experience overall and will definitely be back! 
"
373,"The whole stay and communications arrangements proceeding were so professional and the apartment was just as described.  The location is excellent, on a nice quiet street. Would recommend without hesitation. "
374,"An pleasant experience overall: a shared apartment spanning 3 floors and some 6 rooms total.
An flight of stairs may scare you 91st an beginning, but an conveniently located from the Squares and an big room for a nights stay."
375,Awesome host super friendly.
376,"This is a simple and conveniently located place.  It suited my needs fine, I mostly care about location and having a safe, quiet, comfortable place to crash.  
Like many of the homes in the Cambridge area it a shared older home.  So it is not all shiny, the furniture is a mixture and the only bathroom has lots of shared stuff in it.  
That said, Jade has done a nice job to make the place appealing. She made food and beverages available in the pantry and fridge, and put some gorgeous fresh flowers in the room along with two chocolates.  The linens are new and high quality and the bed is firm with a soft foam topper. These little touches made us feel welcome. 
"
377,"David's apartment is awesome. Super central, massive space and David was really responsive to any questions we had during our stay. "
378,"We stayed four nights at Carolyn's. We had a great stay, the house is very clean and comfortable. It's very well located to get to downtown, only a 5-10mn walk to get to the train station.
Carolyn is a great host. We spent a great time talking about our experience. She also gave us very useful tips (restaurants, she called a car rental company for us, etc).
Highly recommended !
Maybe next time we'll meet up in France !"
379,Gavin's studio was great! The room had everything we needed. It was very clean. Did not have a problem with noise and his instructions for everything were right on point. A+
380,"Staying in the house of Michelle was really great!! She is a wonderful host!! very careful of a guest needs, whenever I needed something & asked her, Michelle helped me in having it, thanks Michelle! 
A warm and comfortable place (with a very comfortable bed!), very convenient and very close to all the places I wanted to go while staying in Boston. Michelle can provide you with a lot of advices about what you can do, where to go (cafe', bars, restaurants, arts entertainments, etc.) & what to see in Boston. 
Plus, I enjoyed very healthy organic & natural breakfasts :) yummy! 
A place I will for sure recommend to my friends planning a trip to Boston!
"
381,"I would highly recommend this home. The listing is modern yet cozy, with lots of space for our family.  Our host was very accommodating and we appreciated his timely responses once we were confirmed.  Check-in was very easy and we didn't have any hassles in the least.  "
382,"We had a wonderful time at Justin and Heidi's home. They have a beautiful view with rooftop dining, and are located super close to North End. They were very accommodating, left us a basket full of treats and were easy to contact and quick to respond. We are looking forward to our next trip to Boston and hope to be welcomed back to their Super-fun, Marvel-lous, Wonder-ful home. "
383,Courtney! Your place was beautiful and my cast was very pleased with their stay.  Thank you again for accommodating my special request.  The filming went swimmingly!
384,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time at Milicent's! She is very sweet and provided us with excellent suggestions for restaurants in the area (The Buttery in particular was delicious). The apartment was clean, bright, and conveniently located. I would absolutely stay here again! "
385,"This place was a great location and perfect fit for our two day stay. It was simple, had everything we needed, and was walking distance to everything. Jason was very helpful and accommodating. "
386,"We relocated to Boston from California and stayed with Duane for an entire month so that we could find a place to call our own. The apartment is older but very well maintained and very clean. The bathroom was shared  with other tenants but we did not find it inconveniencing since there was no conflict in shower scheduling. 

As described by other reviewers, Duane is a most gracious host that will go out of his way to make his guests feel welcome and at home. He got up at the same time as we did in order to prepare breakfast and he took me to the laundry place and the grocery store when we did not have our car available.

Also, the house is located close to public transportation - which is very very convenient.
"
387,"Victor was great about getting back in touch quickly to answer any questions.  Everything was nice, neat & clean plus he had coffee, beer & wine waiting for us - what's not to like?  The area is very close to the T & an easy ride into Boston.  The immediate vicinity is safe with plenty of restaurants, bars & little stores.  I would definitely stay here again if I made my way back to Boston."
388,"Excellent accomodation - great area of Boston, very clean and great use of space with plenty of storage space available.  Walking distance to public transport and the main sights.  Edward was an absolute pleasure to deal with - very quick to respond and helpful.  I would absolutely recommend Edward's studio, and we look forward to staying here again next time we're in Boston!"
389,"Andree was great, and so was the room. Enjoyed a beautiful shower, stocked with fragrance-free shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel (a big plus for me, since I'm sensitive to scents.). 

Andree was welcoming and helpful, and even cooked me dinner while we sat out the ""superstorm"" Sandy. 

I'd definitely come back, and recommend this place to others. 3"
390,"This was our second Airbnb experience and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Sara's.  We arrived from Logan Airport on the subway, all instructions and arrangements were so easy to follow.  Communication with Sara is excellent.  Sara's sister met us and very kindly let us leave our luggage before checking in as we were early. 
We met Sara later that evening, she was very friendly and welcoming. The apartment is lovely and clean and very convenient for Boston (one stop away on the subway - which is only a short walk from the apartment) and there are local shops nearby if you need anything.  However, we only needed milk as Sara  had thought of everything to make our stay enjoyable.  
You must visit the local park which is a few minutes walk away from Sara's, as the view of Boston's skyline is amazing!  (NB the park was closed after 10pm).  Sara also let us leave our luggage after check-out as we had an evening flight.  
We found the neighbourhood and apartment very quiet would recommend staying at Sara's.  
Thank you Sara for a comfortable stay!
Helen and Paul from England
"
391,"This room was clean, comfortable and well furnished. This room is ideal for multiple travelers looking to share a room, as it is large and well ventilated. (Though, having this room to yourself is a bonus luxury.) Having the TV and sofa were nice additions!

The location of this property, Allston, is fantastic for anyone looking to be near public transportation (train/bus), restaurants, groceries, schools (BU/BC/Harvard/MIT and many others), nightlife and a lively neighborhood. Overall, Ari was quick to respond and take care of my stay here. Highly recommended!"
392,"So I will begin with the 2 positive thoughts Great location and Eddy was great( Ahmed's Assitant)
With that being said I would never stay here again. The room was in total construction mode and I was made aware of this the day I arrived even though I booked months ago. The light fixture was dangling, open holes everywhere, dust and debris covered the whole kitchen which made it unusable. I am shocked that Airbnb allows this place to be a representation of them. Ahmed could've notified me ahead of time as I would have prefer to pay more and stay some where else. I also asked if this place had been inspected for asbestos to which I never received an answer. Further more, I will be filing a complaint with the city of Boston as I'm sure they would like to know that city code is being ignored. "
393,"Ariel's description of her apartment was very accurate. The 2BR condo was warm, inviting, clean and in a fantastic part of Jamaica Plain. All of the check-in/check-out logistics worked seamlessly. While ""as advertised"" is a bit of a boring response, it's exactly what we hope for all AirBNB rentals."
394,Upon arrival Eugene welcomed us to the house and showed us around. The house was clean and just the way it was described. A few bottles of cold bier and water were waiting for us in the fridge. Perfect location to explore Cambridge and Boston areas. 
395,The reservation was canceled 26 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
396,"Wendy's apartment was just perfect for what we needed! Plenty of space for me and my three friends to hang out while visiting boston. The diacription and pictures accurately represent the space!
The porch off the back was great and having an off street parking spot gave us the comfort to rely on public transportation. "
397,"Great place in the North End of Boston. Place just as described with a great location. Easy walking distance to harbor and subway. Lots of great Italian restaurants around. Fun being in heart of little Italy. 
Would definitely stay here again!"
398,Very sweet and accommodating. Very roomy and clean space. 
399,"Ben is a welcoming and attentive host, and the place is super cosy. If you have an interest in good books or music check out his collection ! Would recommend for the style of the place, the relaxed atmosphere, and the bonus of having a genuinely friendly host. Also nice to have access to the kitchen and some tasty (healthy) treats. The only issue I had was with the lock for the outside door being a bit finicky - hopefully that will get fixed so there's no problem with coming and going. Thanks Ben !"
400,Nice apartment in an amazing location. Alishya hospitality is very good. Our little boy has enjoyed a lot playing with her two cats.
401,"Amazing location, clean, and true to photos.  If you're not a big fan of steep stairs, I would not recommend this apartment, however, I was very happy to stay here and call the North End home for our trip to Boston.  We were literally steps from the Old North Church and were able to soak in a neighborhood full of great food and smells that other tourists typically only spend a few hours in.  We were also about a ten minute walk to two different T stops and blocks from the water and historical sites.   

The apartment was quiet and equipped with an air conditioning unit that kept the bedroom cool at night.  My one gripe is that both the faucet in the kitchen and bathroom shower needed to be dipped in CLR or something as both kind of sprayed in the wrong directions (the kitchen faucet sprayed out onto the counter and the bathroom shower head seemed to spray in all directions except for on your head).  These were really minimal issues though, just feedback for the future.

Check in/check out was easy as was communication with the hosts.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
402,"Great location, quiet street, nice studio apartment, would recommend it and would stay there next time in Boston. Owners were kind enough to wait and hand over the keys as my flight was late.  "
403,"Jose detailed a very easy set of instructions, which made getting into and leaving the unit an easy experience.  He made himself available and was very helpful.  Location, location, location, excellent start and end to a day's exploration of Boston."
404,Donna was a great host and I would recommend going there any time.
405,The flat has all the listed amenities and is more spacious than the impression given by the pictures. The location is well-connected to public transport (the choice of 3 green T lines made it easy to travel) and there is a large health food store nearby. Elena was accommodating and quick in communications. We had a comfortable stay!
406,"Amy's appartment is very clean and very well situated event if it's not in Boston (very close from the ""T"", close to the museums...). It's well adapted  up to 4 people to stay a few days but i would not say it's easy to have lunches or even breakfasts in the appartment.
Moreover Amy's offered us a free coupon with Uber and that was very helpful !"
407,"I don't think you can get much closer to  Harvard Yard and the Residential Houses than with Ana's apartment. Perfect for this visiting parent and people coming in for interviews. Ana was very fast in responding to my questions. When I arrived, she met me to give me the key and a mini-tour- use of a computer with wifi, kitchen facilities and coffee press. The guest room is very spacious and clean with a double bed, small couch, dining/worktable and chairs. The shared bathroom and kitchen are small as expected but very clean and Ana provided a coffee press, towel, and shampoo.  Even though I didn't see Ana again after that initial meeting, she texted each day to ask if I needed anything and gave me tips on where to find what I needed. When my departing flight was in danger of being canceled due to weather, she invited me to stay another night without charge if I needed to- super thoughtful. Fortunately my plane got out just in time. I will definitely book with her again if I return to Harvard."
408,"I would very much recommend staying with Peter & Stella, what a nice couple! From the minute I arrived they made me feel at home. They have a very friendly dog and cat that are adorable. I slept great and hope to stay again when I visit Boston. Thanks again! "
409,Kate was a wonderful host and excellent at accommodating our last minute reservation. Our previous host cancelled on the day of our arrival and Kate lend a helping hand. Her house is beautiful and she has the cutest pets. Her bathroom and kitchen is nice and clean. The nearest T-stop is at Jackson Square and it is a 10minute walk. I would recommend walking with friends at night at that stop but everything else is great!
410,"Great experience in Boston, Jay was a great Host sadly we didn't get to meet him however he was so accommodating with us leaving our luggage early etc. 
Jays place is so special its new very clean and very quiet, it's in a great area lots of cafes bars and shops to explore and beautiful cobbled streets to walk down.
Jay gave us great directions to get to the airport by train everything was Easy we highly recommend this place.
Thanks so much for a great stay Jay we loved every minute .
All the best Debbie "
411,"We had a very pleasant stay Jair's place, the apartment is located in a quiet, convenient location to explore the areas in and around Cambridge. Jair's apartment is exactly as described; clean and tidy, the bed is very comfortable, the kitchen super equipped! Jair was incredibly kind to be able to accommodate us within a fairly short notice. We would like to thank him again for hosting us!"
412,"We loved Melissa's apartment. The location is excellent - close to multiple trains, and easy travel to Cambridge/Harvard and the MFA, Boston. The neighborhood is amazing, and the street and building are quiet. The space is super cute and very clean, with luxurious sheets and towels! There was also a basket in the bathroom with odds and ends that guests may have forgotten, which was a nice touch.  "
413,"Meghan's apartment was very clean and just as pictured. We felt welcomed right away with her bedside note and coffee in the morning. We did not spend enough time in the apartment, although it was beautiful and very comfortable.  It was our first time in Boston and the train station was no more than 10 mins walk away. Along the way to there is also a little cafe and bakery that supplied our treats on the run. Would definitely stay here again!"
414,Good location. Convenient to anywhere. The room D is big enough. The kitchen is big and equipped with all the things that need. But the room and the shared bathroom could be made more clean.
415,"We stayed for 9 nights during late January 2015.

The apartment was perfect. Very clean,  exceptionally quiet, everything as specified including a very well equipped kitchen.

The location couldn't have been better and, even though we stayed during a major snowstorm, the property was always very warm and homely.

Although we didn't meet Nick in person his communications were excellent and we felt confident we could contact him at any time and he would be of help. 

Within a short time of landing at Logan airport Nick messaged me with further confirmation of the location of the apartment and the method of entry just in case we had mislaid the details after a long flight. A nice touch. 

There was also a welcome note and a bottle of wine waiting for us in the apartment. An even nicer touch!

I can't think of one negative thing to say about the apartment, its location or Nick.

Thank you!"
416,"Ben and Andy were VERY welcoming and helpful.  Their home is lovely and quite modern, very clean.  The pups are adorable and quiet; we only saw them a few times.  Very comfortable room and bed, and we liked having a separate entrance.  We highly recommend staying there."
417,Ralph was very helpful meeting us. The studio apartment was great for all our needs. Great views.
418,"Great spot! Key pick up is seamless, public transportation is close by, and Dave was super helpful and responsive. "
419,"Kathe is the nicest person ever!!
She helped us find the attractions in Boston and explained how to get around the city.
The room is a bit small but there's closet space so it's manageable espcially if you don't want to pay a fortune for a hotel
The room and the bathroom were very clean and comfortable.."
420,"Great stay, very comfortable and Rosalia was very nice as a host. Thank you!"
421,"This is not a luxury hotel, but it was the perfect place for a night in Boston. It was very clean and easy to get to/from, and Izzy's assistant, Victoria was very helpful. I'd definitely recommend it for an inexpensive place to stay in Boston!"
422,"Staying at the Grand Colonial was a mixed experience. The owner was incredibly helpful in getting us set up and helping us with all of our questions and access. The home itself was a little hard to get comfortable in considering there was no real space to relax (or at least no comfortable space) and the heating situation was hard to manage. But, we love the neighborhood and appreciated our time in Boston."
423,"We had a great stay at John's place. Everything was clean and tidy, and as we were expecting based on the pictures. There are some services around on Center St, which was nice. There was a coffee for for example, called El Record, that made excellent lattes!

Overall great experience, if we go back to Boston and have a chance to reserve John's place again, we would!

Thank you to the hosts "
424,"Marco was a very nice host and the place was as described. The location is perfect and is a 4 minute walk to Harvard Square. Trains are very convenient to the city center and MIT.

Marco ensured we had everything that we needed. The Victorian house is very well maintained and has a beautiful terrace to sit in peace and enjoy tea/coffee. I recommend this to fellow travelers to Boston or Cambridge."
425,"This apt is really good! It's well equipped. Mac is really helpful, he could always give timely help like buying us toothpaste and even milk chocolate . Well, the toilet was blocked up and I don't know if my friend did it or not, anyway, Mac and his partner had it fixed immediately. The only thing needs to be improved is the laundry. $1.5 for washing and another $1.5 for drying and the basement is a little scary for girls. All in all, it's good."
426,"It's hard to imagine a better landing pad than JP Green House: clean room, private bathroom, great shower, private entrance, free wi-fi, easy walk to T & a breeze into Boston, plus free on-street parking.  Kudos to the host!"
427,"The listing is totally accurate.  Everything was just as described.  The space is really well laid out, and Sarah has thought of everything including maps of Boston, pens and paper on the desk - even a first aid kit in the bathroom!  The neighborhood is super cute - lots of great places to eat and shop with easy access to public transportation.  It was cold and snowy while we were there, but the carriage house was very cozy.  Sarah was easy to communicate with and quick to respond to any questions.  We would definitely stay here and again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place in JP."
428,"We just returned from Boston. Had an incredible time and couldn't have been happier with our airbnb experience with Lyndsay. The place was incredibly nice, clean and cozy. The host Lyndsay was incredibly kind, helpful and accommodating. The location was very easy to get access the subway into the city. Such a great time exploring from this location. I would definitely go back again!!!"
429,"Salman and Nabihah are awesome hosts!  Their home is welcoming and immaculately clean.  The guest room has an extremely comfortable bed and relaxing atmosphere, which was crucial for my sister and I during a very hectic wedding weekend.  The location is in a peaceful, quiet neighborhood of Brookline with close access to the T.  I would absolutely stay with them again!  The best part of their place by far was their amazingly adorable, friendly little dog Toto!!"
430,"As a first experience of Airbnb, staying at Sid's place in Boston was a great one. 

The studio is set down a courtyard and is very private in the lovely neighbourhood of South End (plenty of great restaurants and bars on Tremont Street) and provided a great base from which to explore the city. The studio was tidy, clean and came with a very comfy bed. There was no air con, but opening the windows and the powerful fan ensured the studio could be cooled down quickly. I only saw Sid on check in although he did mention that he was on email for any issues or questions that we had which was reassuring. We had a train to catch from Back Bay and staying here meant we only had a 10-15 minute walk to the station. There are plenty of buses to the studio itself and getting the 'T' proved easy too.

The refrigerator was a little noisy, chuntering into life every half an hour or so. It was fine for this deep sleeper and it didn't wake me up,  but for a lighter sleeper I would recommend ear plugs."
431,"Me and my friend had a very good trip in Boston, because we stayed in here and had really nice sleeps. Comfortable room, nice old couples and a cute cat whose name is Darwin."
432,"The studio was the perfect space for us during our trip.  It was very cute and cozy.  We appreciated the convenience of having a kitchen and it was a short walk to the transit station. Although we didn't get a chance to meet our hosts, we were able to communicate with Chris and Kristina via text.   We definitely recommend their studio and would love to stay there again the next time we are in town. "
433,"Very convenient location in the heart of the north end.
Anthony was very welcoming and helpful.
The apartment was roomy but maybe a little dirty."
434,"I suppose you can ask the Red Sox to set up a cot inside the Green Monster. Other than that, though, it's hard to imagine someplace more convenient to Fenway Park. The apartment is clean, quiet, and secure, and absolutely in the epicenter of Red Sox Nation. I was there for four games, and could not believe how convenient it was -- door-to-door, it's about 4 minutes to Fenway. And if you're not going to the game, the park still makes a great vista to enjoy from the roof deck. Kenmore Square is full of restaurants and nightlife, and there's a Starbucks for the morning, too. And Naomi couldn't be more accommodating. I get to Boston once or twice a year for Red Sox games, and can't remember a setup better than this one."
435,"They were very welcoming, provided delightful breakfast, and the pleasure of their company."
436,"Our stay with Gary was a great experience. Everything in the apartment was exactly as on the pictures. It was clean and it was big enough to host our family of 4. Gary had left a bottle of wine and brochures of what to see while in Boston when we arrived. We found this to be  a very nice gesture. 
Gary responded fast to the few questions we had during our stay and in generel the communication  before our stay and during our stay was very accurate and informative. 
We would definately recommend staying at Gary<b4>s place. "
437,Danielle's place is lovely and so clean! It's located in a quiet and safe area and is really close to the subway station. I had a great stay there and will be coming again in October. I definitely recommend it!
438,"Soledad & Rodrigo's place was great.  Very clean, comfortable, a pleasure to stay in.  Communication was great and timely.  Highly recommended."
439,"Joe is a great host! He gave me a warm welcome when I arrived and showed me round the town. I was in Boston for the worst snowfalls on record and Joe made sure I was warm and even lent me some winter gear. The location is perfect for exploring Charlestown, with easy access to the rest of Boston. Highly recommended!"
440,Apartment was exactly as described and host was very accommodating and flexible. The stuffed bear was a gentleman. 
441,"Awesome host, responsive professional, handled a late booking for accommodation for industry conference at MCCA with ease. Lovely location, apartment exactly as in images. Would definitely recommend and will happily return with family in the future."
442,Katherine was a very gracious host and was there to greet me and see that I had everything I needed. Her place was exactly as described and is in a fun section of Allston. I recommend her to anyone looking to stay in that area of the city. 
443,Johnathan was the most gracious host and was available upon arrival.  He certainly made me feeling comfortable and welcome.  The pictures of the  location were exactly as they were upon arrival.  I would definitely go back on my next trip to Boston.
444,"Last weekend i stayed my Ed's place and it was awesome. Its a really nice cozy studio apt, in a really beautiful browstone location, and being from brooklyn it was a really nice feel. The Apt itself had everything you could want, updated kitchen, huge tv with all the channels, a nice electric fireplace. Overall although i only got to see Ed the day i left, he was always by his phone with anything i needed or any questions, he even gave us some nice recommendations. i would recommend to get the parking if anyone comes with their own car, parking is hard to find.
I hope ill be back!"
445,"I interacted mostly with Matt, Jason's roommate. I had a very pleasant stay, both Matt and Jason are very friendly and made me feel very welcome. On my way out Jason gave me a ride to the T. I would stay there again. "
446,Prem was an excellent host.  I was in town for a BC game with 2 of my friends and we had more than enough space.  The place is spotless and kept up very well.  Location makes it easy to get many places in the city.  I'd stay here again 
447,My parents stayed here while visiting Boston and they loved the apartment! Everything was as described and very clean. The area was very quiet and accessible by T. There was never a time when my parents even needed to use their car as they were exploring all of Boston. The free parking spot was incredibly convenient as well! Would very highly recommend!!
448,"Izzy was nowhere to be seen during my whole (short) stay, but the directions I received showed me the right way and the house housed everything I needed, including two lovely roommates and a more than friendly, helpful and welcoming brother of Izzy."
449,"Lacking in day to day items. Not many cooking utensils. No information on the area about shops & so forth. A little out of the way. 
Beds were uncomfortable "
450,"My stay there was great. It's easy to get there by Boston transportation, and would definitely stay there again."
451,"Casey was out when we came, but she helped us with finding a restraurant and she made the amenities and the house accessible. The room was very comfortable, as was the rest of the house. "
452,"It pains me to say this but the only positive things from this experience were location and communication. The south end is very convenient and beautiful and the response time was great. 
Unfortunately, everything else left much to be desired. When we arrived after an 8 hour drive, within one hour, we were disturbed twice by someone there to ""show"" the place. The man was very friendly and apologetic about it but it was not the best way to start a trip when you're trying to nap. 
The walls are made of...paper? The three nights we spent were soundtracked by a man with a constant cough, spitting up phlegm so loud that we had to use our computer to download relaxation music to drown out the sound at night in order to sleep (which was not restful because the bed is uncomfortable). You can hear EVERYTHING (I mean everything) through these walls as though it's all in your room. We had to take very short showers because the drain wouldn't drain so within a few minutes the bottom had filled with water to your ankles. Not cool. Perhaps I should've read a bit more closely, but typically through an airbnb, something is provided like soap in the shower, or mini shampoo or conditioner bottles. Nope. Not here. So we had to make a run to CVS. Lastly, the place smells wet, like mildew and the first time we tried to open the top drawer, it was broken so we ended up living out of our suitcases as opposed to putting anything away, which made this TINY room even smaller. I'll be sure to check whether my next airbnb experience is a ""short term rental"" like this or someone's actual apartment. Would not recommend this place at all, unfortunately. 
"
453,Great location.. The room was very comfortable and clean..you have all you need! 10 minutes to downtown..If I have the chance to come back to Boston I ll return in this beautiful location!!
454,Sara was great to communicate with. Her place is as pictured. It is close to the airport and was great for a stopover. The stairs down are not the ones pictured however they are tight with suitcases. 
455,"Excellent studio apartment right near a T stop. Was easy to find and in a good spot. Victor left us a great selection of beer, soda and snacks as well as recommendations for dinner. He made sure we felt at home and was very friendly. The Apple TV was greatly appreciated! All in all, a very good experience."
456,Michelle is an informative and fun host. Her accommodations are basic and comfortable. The breakfast was delightful. She likes to bake and shares her yummy goodies with her guests. She is a long time Bostonian and shares her knowlege with her guests. 
457,"Me and my boyfriend stayed 2 nights at Peter's place. It has been a real pleasure for us and we enjoyed our time very much. We were allowed to use the whole appartment because Peter was away for weekend. Appartment was very clean and was a nice and cozy place to hang out for us. T-Station is like a 10 minute walk away and also a walk to the sea takes about 15 minutes. Unfortunately we could not meet in person, but maybe next time! :) "
458,"My husband stayed at Susan's place during a recent trip to Boston for a conference. Susan was very communicative and attentive during the reservation process. She sent out a questionnaire prior to arrival asking for our travel plans and breakfast preferences.  Upon return my husband raved about Susan, both as a person and as a perfect host.  He said that her granola and breakfasts were ""amazing"".  Susan runs a tight ship so that all her guests have a wonderful experience. She's been a host for awhile and she knows just how to make people feel at home.  We would definitely stay here again.  Thanks Susan! "
459,"As a family we had been planning once last holiday for all 5 of us to give and as it was my mum'a 60th she chose where we went. We started the holiday in Boston staying in Trisha's apartment. Having never been before, it was a quick 10 minute journey from the airport cost $30 between us. The apartment gave us a lot more room than we would have had than if we were in a hotel although you wouldn't necessarily have a big sit down meal but the table is great for breakfast or for a quick lunch. Also the flexibility with meals which is important as the youngest is a student so doesn't have a lot of money. The best thing apartment this apartment is the location. North End is an incredible area being so close to the harbour, downtown Boston, Quincey market and the subway. We were able to walk most places or if not hop on a subway which is what we needed as my mum wanted to cover a lot of history in the short amount of time we had. North end feels incredibly welcoming and the food and shops are fantastic. We were there for St Anthony's which was a fantastic atmosphere with live music and stalls and everyone willing to have a chat to you.  This is a great apartment for location and the apartment itself feels clean and modern. "
460,"The apartament was very comfortable, very big and spacious bedroom with everything you may need. The kitchen was complete and the coffee was amazing :) 
Cristina is an incredible person, host and roommate. She helped me with everything to make my trip and my stay an unforgettable experience. I felt at home while staying at Boston. "
461,"Host was very responsive and explained everything well. Good location, close to subway to go downtown.  $10-15 to come back via Uber. Room nice and clean. Only downside was the shared bathroom was not cleaned properly. For the price though I would consider this place again any day."
462,"I absolutely loved this apartment! It had so much charm, comfort, nice space, and character. The pictures are all accurate and the experience of living in it was better than I could hope for. I stayed for a full month and was calling it home after a week. The deck is heavenly and is facing a lovely church where Ted Kennedy's memorial was held back in the day. As for the exteriors, it is located on a lovely little street called Worthington, lined up with brown stone 2-3 floor homes with families and young people together, absolutely wonderful. It is literally a 1-2 min walk to the Green line metro stops Brigham Circle and Longwood, as well as the Stop & Shop Market where you can buy groceries. I also enjoyed dining at the Mission Sushi & Thai restaurant and the Penguin cafe in that same area. Anne was wonderful, very professional and made me feel safe and secure. Another bonus is the 2nd floor neighbor who works at the company that takes care of the maintenance of this apt so if there were any problems with heating etc, which there were none when I stayed, he would be there to immediately take care of it. Wonderful experience overall, thank you Anne. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
463,"My experience in this lovely house is wonderful. Host offered us delicious breakfast and everything we need (bottles of water, clean towels, wifi) for our two-day stay. She even offered to pick us up and drop off us off at the airport, which is very considerate. The bedroom is large and comfy, the bathroom is quite clean although we need to share with others. Overall, I had a wonderful stay here:)"
464,"Beth is an amazing host. It was our first trip with airbnb. We stayed at her place for two weeks while we were relocating to Boston. Her house is really nice with art at every corner. Jen and Beth made us feel really at home. They both are very nice people. We had our privacy, but also got to chat with them. They gave suggestions about places to visit and helped with our apartment search. We are really glad we chose Beth's house."
465,"The room is located in a nice part of the city, we walked downtown and it was about a 25-minute walk, but the bus stops right outside the door. It's small but cozy :)"
466,"This room was everything that was promised and more.  We arrived in the afternoon and took a taxi from the airport to the room. We were let in and showed to our room by Tiffany and she personally made sure that all our questions were answered and needs met.  In the room, she had prepared brochures of all the local activities, including directions on how to get there!  Bath towel, hand towel and wash cloths were provided.  The shared bathroom and shower were my only pre trip concerns and by the first night those concerns were put to rest. 
The room is in a quaint building right off of Cambridge St. and close to everything.  Across the street is the Whole Foods and CVS. It's a 5 minute walk to MGH, the T, D&D & Starbucks.  
In the room is a bed, night stand with reading lamp, desk & chair, sink, microwave, mini fridge window a/c and closet.  The shared 1/2 bath was never busy when I needed it and the shower was open in the morning and evening when I showered.  We never heard our neighbors (and tried not to disturb them), and only saw a few of them as our schedules were different.  If I have to be away from home, I don't mind staying here!"
467,"The room was beautiful, super clean and comfortable, and with a very nice private bath. Stephen and Megan made us feel very welcome. They provided a shelf in the fridge for us to leave our food items, and even left goodies there for us. The neighborhood is great... had an amazing breakfast at Mul's Diner a few minutes away at 75 W Broadway (the creme brulee french toast and the Irish breakfast are not to be missed if you are a breakfast fan). Altogether a great AirBnB experience. Their home is just as pictured...even a cozy gas fire in the living room, and lots of TV options in the bedroom. Stay here, you will love it."
468,"John was super accommodating given that we arrived late on a Saturday night.  He was friendly, and was nice enough to mail back a phone that was left there the very same day, and text back the mail receipt.   The apartment was perfectly situated for the marathon, clean, well kept.  "
469,"The room was exactly as it was listed on the website.  It is small but the bed was comfy, the room clean, and overall pleasantly decorated.  The whole house, in fact, was quite pleasant and enjoyable to be in.  If you're looking for a nice, comfortable, and safe place to put your head at the end of the night I would recommend staying here."
470,"amazing place. loved my stay here.
clean ,organized, comfortable place.
Hermina is such a sweet host. she took care of everything during th stay. felt like home. :-)"
471,"Casa carina, con tutto il necessario! Non troppo chiara la questione dell'arrivo e delle chiavi! Soggiorno confortevole!"
472,"This was a lovely apartment in a lovely part of Boston. Really enjoyed the surroundings...  the area is fun and bustling and an easy walk to downtown. It was incredibly easy to get the keys and return them, and the possibility of luggage storage space after checkout time is very useful! The kitchen was well-equipped and the air conditioning was great. The only slight improvement could've been with cleanliness... for example plates and cups in the cupboards weren't very clean and we had to clean them before use. But that was a very small issue, overall a very very good experience!"
473,It was a short but very easy stay. Lisa makes everything for a five star rating. Thank you!
474,"Nicole's apartment is very cozy (especially the big couch)!  We enjoyed the ability to relax in the living room after walking/riding the T all over Boston.  The bed is comfy, too, and even in the 90 degree heat of the summer, the portable air conditioning unit works great.  It also provides a bit of white noise to lull one to sleep.  We greatly appreciated the ability to make our own breakfast in the kitchen, as well as the  proximity to downtown Cambridge (5-10 min walk) to enjoy a few local eateries and ice cream shops!"
475,"We didn't  have te opportunity  to meet Suzan in person, but she was  very helpful via email and we had a great stay in her cottage. The location is perfect and the space was very clean and pleasant. She went the extra mile to make sure my girlfriend and I were well situated!!!!!! 
Thanks for everything ...."
476,"Staying at Brian's place was wonderful! He was there when I arrived and accommodated an early drop off for my bag so I could make the most of my day in Boston. He was a great host, able to recommend some things for me while being very respectful of my own plans, and great communication prior to arrival. The room is exactly as described and pictured in a quiet neighbourhood but a great location only 4 subway stops away from central downtown Boston. Convenient location, great host, wonderful city and fantastic Air BnB experience. Thank you Brian! :)"
477,Aakash is a great host and his space is great! He left a bottle of wine! Check in was smooth and he was waiting for me right when I arrived and met me right outside his place. I'd definitely stay here again and recommend staying here if your in the Boston area. 
478,"It was a perfect experience. First of all, Robert is very helpful and kind. He provides all necessary information about Boston. Jackie is also very nice and helpful. 
About room: you have everything that you need for a short stay. There are many books, but it's a part of house charm. The bed is not big, but it's comfortable. Clean, good bedclothes, iron in a bathroom, fast wifi, one-cup coffee maker in the room.
The house has a great location, it's 5 min from rail station. The quartier is quite, safe and charming. 
I would return there. 
Thank you, Robert and Jackie, for such a pleasant welcome! "
479,"Gabriella was great.  She was responsive, welcoming and even left a tooth brush for me (which I ended up needing because I forgot mine:)).  

Her place is comfortable, quiet and in a very good location

Would definitely stay again"
480,Chris was a great host. The apartment was very clean and he personally welcomed us into his home. He was quick to respond to any requests and was very attentive to our needs. We will be looking to stay here again in the future!
481,"The unit was easy to get to and only a few minutes walk to the Orange Line. We didn't spend a significant amount of time in the immediate neighborhood, but we enjoyed the space. it was quaint and more than served our needs. The beds and sheets were comfortable, the architectural details helped to set the space off, and the amenities were numerous and easy to use. I was almost always able to get in touch with either Will or the property management company when I needed to, and all parties involved where always courteous and helpful. 

That being said, there were a few minor issues. These are all incredibly nitpicky and did not significantly detract from our stay and enjoyment of the property.

A few of the stairs, either in the unit or on the way up to it, are in need of replacement. We were actively trying to step as close to the riser as possible on these steps to take as much of the load off of the tread as possible.

The cable jack for the TV is missing a face plate and is not secured to the wall; it is simply hanging out next to the tv stand. While this is mainly just a cosmetic issue, it is nonetheless rather interesting that it has not been properly installed.

The downstairs bathroom has the main light switch behind the hand towels, which we didn't realize until someone actually took one of the towels off the rack. It's just an odd/confusing placement, especially if you arrive after dark.

Lastly, the wireless is shared between at least the top two units and the requisite equipment is located in unit 2. We had the wireless go out and require a reset once during our stay, and it caused a few minor hiccups when we were getting ready that morning. A quick call to the Short Term Rentals Boston office (the company that manages the property for Will) was able to remedy this; they contacted the tenets in unit two and had the system reset. 

These were all minor issues and would not prevent me from staying here again or wholeheartedly recommending it to anybody that is considering the property. This is a nice unit with a fairly central location. If you're going to be spending a fair amount of time in the vicinity or traveling around the Boston area it's an excellent choice. It also serves as a far more reasonably priced option if you're going to be around the Cambridge area more but don't want to spend the extra money that would entail; the metro system will easily get you to the Harvard and MIT campuses within 15-20 minutes. "
482,"Scott's place is beautiful and fully equipped with everything you might need. The double tv in the living room and bedroom is definitely a plus! It's very homely and we loved it. Washer dryer worked well. Kitchen was perfect for cooking or baking, tho we didn't. Neighbors are quiet so we had great privacy and peace. Scott is perfect with communication. Recommend it!!
Only downside is there's no metro nearby, but there is a bus service silver line. "
483,Ari is a fantastic host! The rooms are really nicely set up and the location is fantastic! 
484,Very nice bedroom with private in the center of Boston. Laurie was super nice too.
485,"My son and I spent a week in Kevin's apartment.  We enjoyed the neighborhood...it was far more relaxing than North End, Back Bay, etc. The apartment itself was spacious and quiet.  Bonuses were the great kitchen and backyard.  There were a couple of issues that Kevin and his assistant, Liesl, were very responsive to.  Communications with them was always prompt and entry in and out of the apartment is so convenient.  "
486,"Alex and Wayne were really great. Both are very accommodating and incredibly helpful. The apartment is super clean and light breakfast foods were provided. I highly recommend staying with Alex and Wayne if you are in the Charlestown area, as the neighborhood is very nice as well."
487,"We had a wonderful time at Steve's. He was there every morning with Cleo to make sure everything was fine, the room was clean and nice, we had bagels and coffee every morning. The other guests were also very nice. We really felt at home, chilling on the porch at night having a glass of wine. The neighborhood is nice and it is really close to the T slation. Loved our stay and would definitely come back!"
488,This is a great space in a great location. The host was very nice and accommodating.  Had no problems at all and would definitely stay again. 
489,"Easy parking, great location - downtown in 30 minutes or less.  Even though we didn't get to spend much time together, Hermina was very nice and welcoming to us.  Thanks!"
490,"Edward is an amazing host, and the property is absolutely beautiful!"
491,"We had a wonderful stay here.  The space is beautifully decorated, and the host had thought of many things to make the stay pleasant (fresh flowers, sunscreen, even homemade banana bread).  It was easy to find, parking was a cinch, and it was wonderfully nestled between Centre Street and the pond.  I was also surprised and pleased at how cool it stayed.  Thanks for being considerate hosts! "
492,"The apartment was exactly as described and in a great location. 

Communication with Ravi was really good and check in/out was straightforward. We thought it was good value for the area and would stay again if we returned to Boston. 

Parking was a bit of a nightmare, but that's not Ravi's fault by any means, just something to be aware of if you're driving there;  we eventually found a multi-story car park for $30 for 24hrs about 15 minutes walk away. 

We'd definitely recommend the apartment to others."
493,"Our stay at the Mayhew was just okay. We communicated throughout our stay with John of Swank Properties through the AirBNB messaging system. If you stay in a Swank Property, it will feel a bit more corporate because you're renting from a company rather than staying in a person's home. Before arriving, John was very accommodating in allowing us to access the apartment a few hours before scheduled check-in time. The apartment was very clean and spacious, and all amenities we could've needed were provided. There's a coffee shop a short walk away, a restaurant right next door, and it is conveniently located between two T stops.

Unfortunately, on the second week, we lost both AC and hot water in the apartment. We were told neither could be fixed until after our stay was going to be over. We did ask to have access to another unit for showers, but we did not receive a reply before our stay ended. 

Needless to say, our stay at The Mayhew was colored due to the issues with the apartment."
494,"We recommend this place! The apartment is big and clean. The hosts were very attentive and welcoming, very responsive before & during our stay and flexible to help us out when our flight got canceled last minute :) "
495,Jason is a fabulous host. We had the best time in his beautiful apartment. The space is open and generous and Jason was helpful with every part of our visit. I can't recommend his place highly enough. The location is ideal and you will be very comfortable!
496,"Andrew is a very good host - responsive, friendly and respectful.  The bedroom and bath I rented were comfortable and private, tasteful and clean. The location, in an older ethnic neighborhood, was perfect for my purposes - about 10 to 15 minutes by Uber to almost anywhere in Boston. "
497,"Boston was an amazing city. I had a wonderful time. Sean was very easy to get in touch with and it was very nice of him to store my luggage after checkout. The apartment itself is spacious enough for 1-2 people. There was a hairdryer and iron if needed. There were a couple of things that bothered me, first of all it needs a goooood cleaning. There was dust everywhere..and some things need to be replaced. The shower was not very inviting to take a long shower but it did the job. Secondly it is very dark in the apartment! And thirdly the noise. You could hear people everywhere-outside, in the hallway and above you! And the fridge is super loud and because it is right next to the bed it bothered me at night. Nevertheless the stay overall was good. Sean seems like a nice guy and the location can't be beaten- you can walk to most places!! "
498,"Great experience. Raphael was very responsive and accommodating. The room was clean upon arrival - towels laid out and two bottled waters provided. The private bath was appreciated.

Before check-in, Raphael found us multiple overnight parking options and responded quickly to our messages. We only briefly saw Raphael and his roommates, but everyone was friendly.

The T and bus stops are right around the corner, and the neighborhood is full of restaurants, coffee shops and bars.
"
499,"Katy and Ashley were very nice hosts. Their apartment is great, the room we were staying in was very comfy. They helped us navigate the city and the sights. It was a great way to experience Boston. 
Conclusion: We have to go back :-)
We can only recommend them as hosts
10/10"
500,"Had a wonderful stay at Deborah's place. The pictures were exactly what the real space looked like. It's a really beautiful space with a convenient location. 

Deborah was great communicating with me via text and was amenable to changing the arrival time since my flight got delayed. 

I had clean sheets, clean towels, amenities, etc. Everything was perfect for my stay. Will definitely come back! "
501,Excellent host. The house and room are exactly as described. No hassles getting in or out. I had a great time. Thanks Izzy!
502,"Ned is communicating very clear. We found a printed version of the house manual with additional details and also recommendations on restaurants, pharmacy, transportation etc. mostly helpful! Ned was a responsive host, replying our questions almost immediately.  Important to note that the apartment was very clean!! like in high-grade hotel!! the bed was comfortable. 
The description of the listing was accurate. The apartment is in a great location, nice neighborhood and indeed close to everything! will be happy to stay there again in the future."
503,Owen was a fantastic host & very accommodating - meeting us very late on the night we flew into Boston. He left us a great list of restaurant & shop recommendations for nearby which came in very handy. His place was in a great location in North End. Would definitely recommend Owen's place for other visitors.
504,Everything about this place was perfect. Close enough to the T station or Hubway bike rentals to get into downtown but also quiet and residential. Great places to eat are just around the corner (highly recommend Corner Street Cafe for brunch). Sarah was accommodating to our arrival and departure needs. The apartment has everything you need and is beautifully furnished.  
505,We didn't see The hosts but the house was very easy to find and get into. The display of breakfast food in the kitchen was great. The room was a little dated but very cozy and clean.
506,"I had a great week staying with Michelle in Roxbury, she's an amazing host who really knows the area and how to bake some awesome cookies! I'll be staying here for sure when I'm next back in Boston."
507,"Oh! My! Goodness!  Muching's family, house and room were all amazing.  [Note: Muching was not there, but her mother, Nancy, and her step-father Junzuo, along with a couple of long-term renters -Charles and Jim- were.]  Nancy helped get us there when we got lost and called.  She invited us to eat dinner with them.  She's a full time teacher and cooks great food.  Charles helped us understand the bus and train system.  Jim helped us with maps and bike routes. Junzuo was extremely intelligent and interesting to talk to.  
Our bedroom and bathroom were impeccably clean.   
We had a perfect guest experience, and highly recommend this place to anyone.     We will stay here again whenever we go to Boston."
508,"Alex was a lifesaver and hosted us (me and my fiancé ) with very short notice. It is a very nice house with a BIG room with your own bath, just great. We only stayed one night, arrived late and left quite early but we liked it a lot. Really nice people and we both loved their cute cats. "
509,"My stay at Shawn's place was great. The room I got is spacious and comfortable and everything was as described. Bathroom was also very good. House is at walking distance from a T station and is fairly easy to get from there to the main points in the city. I unfortunately did not manage to interact personally with Shawn, but our online conversation was always very nice and friendly. Shawn replied to my messages pretty quickly and was always very helpful. I definitely recommend his place."
510,"The whole experience at Katherine's place was great. The apartment is in very good conditions, perfect size for a couple and so well located in the city. Across the street is the subway station which takes you downtown in less than 15 minutes.
Katherine is a great host, even though we didn't had the chance to meet her, she was always available by phone and solved any question we had.
I totally recommend this place for sure we are coming back.

Omar & Claudia"
511,"We are a family of four and it was our first time visiting Boston to settle our daughter/sister for school here. We had a lovely stay at Kenzi's. They are extremely warm and were chirpy ally here throughout to take care of us. We did not feel like we were away from home at all. It was almost as if we were physically being hosted at the apartment. It was a great experience, the location is 5 stars and I highly recommend the apartment to anyone visiting Boston. Just one note, the apartment is on the second floor. My only regret is that I could not meet the family in person. :) "
512,"I needed a place to stay just for one night and I needed it to be close to the financial district, in walking distance of South Station. This was perfect for me! It is a really easy, short walk from South Station and in a nice neighbourhood. Jazz is a wonderful host, very kind and helpful and her room is just beautiful. The bed was as comfortable as my bed at home and the bed linen was lovely! The room, the bathroom and the rest of the apartment were all spotlessly clean and tidy. It was only a short stay but it was a good one! Thanks so much."
513,"The host was beyond wonderful, neighborhood was quite pleasant and the listing was spot on. I hope my daughter can stay here and I will recommend this listing to anyone who mentions wanting to travel to Boston."
514,"James' apartment is awesome! First of all the apartment is very spacious and homey, but even more perfect was the location. You are walking distance from everything! Couple blocks away are the Back Bay train station, great shops and restaurants on Newbury street, the Charles River Esplanade and Boston Common. James was also a great host. He's very responsive, flexible, and nice enough to leave an extra air mattress for us. Highly recommend!"
515,"Atef is a great host, he recieved me and gave a lot of info about the city hot spots. He's place is awsome, big and comfortable, nice patio, great location, I walked almost to everywhere from there but you have public transportation real close too. My next time in Boston I'm staying here again for sure, Charlestown is a beautifull neighborhood."
516,Izzy's communication is very good. All communication was done via text or AirBnB messaging. Directions and house details were well spelled out & clear. I was in the basement room of the 3 rooms he rents out. Everything is clean but spares. I would not consider it cozy but it was a very good value. 
517,"I absolutely recommend staying here! Gerald is an incredibly welcoming and friendly host. He has a beautiful, unique home, and I am very thankful that he opened it to us. I appreciated that we could have as much privacy as we needed, with a private entrance, but we could also hang out in the common areas. The location is terrific - it is a very short walk to the Back Bay T stop. This is a really good choice for a stay in Boston. "
518,"Evelyn was one of the most welcoming and considerate hosts that I've had the pleasure of meeting through AirBnB.  She has a terrific home, a great private guest suite (at the top of the house) and goes out of her way to make guests feel welcome.  I would highly recommend her, and her home, to anyone considering a stay in Boston!  

And, to those that are leery of traveling outside of the downtown section, this is a wonderfully safe community with lots of great authentic restaurants in close walking distance."
519,"The host is gracious, kind, and wonderful. They were accommodating to our needs and made sure that we were taken care of. The location is awesome, literally just a few steps away from a Train stop which takes you to the heart of Boston. The view of the Boston skyline is AMAZING! There is a park close by, and enjoyable walkways are also near.  The apartment is very modern, with a gym, an incredible lounge with multiple TVs and a pool table, and there is even a conference center if you wish to work. We have thoroughly enjoyed staying that this location. Everything was a win. Location + Hosts + Accommodation + Venue = an incredible experience."
520,Excellent experience. Highly recommendable. 
521,This apartment is beautiful!  Andrew was great and made us feel really welcome in Boston.   The apartment is in a really great location and was super clean.   Andrew gave us a few really good recommendations for grabbing a beer/dinner.  I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Boston!
522,"Bob was an awesome host!  He was very welcoming upon our arrival, and then he and his partner actually left for the night so we had the whole place to ourselves.  His apartment was immaculate - it looked exactly like the photos.  It was as nice as a hotel, but more comfortable and more spacious.  When we arrived, Bob had stocked the fridge with milk and juice for our toddler and put out a sweet treat for us.  When we were ready to go, he even offered us a ride to the bus station so we would not have to lug our bags on the train.  We will definitely stay there again if we are in Boston."
523,Doug is sooo nice. And the house is really so good! It's a smart choice for me to have a perfect experience in Boston.
524,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Charlestown this past weekend. Gerard and Marie's home is welcoming and spacious; absolutely perfect for the four of us during our trip. I especially enjoyed the architectural details of the home. In addition to providing coffee, juice and creamer, Marie gave us very helpful advice on parking and attractions upon arrival. We found everything we needed just steps away: grocery store, the Freedom Trail, subway, etc. Wish we could've stayed longer and hope to return again someday!"
525,The reservation was canceled 35 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
526,Great location and apartment. We had no problems at the place.
527,"Cindy was a wonderful host and her home was charming, cozy and beautiful.  She made sure the fridge was stocked with things we liked, left us sweets and flowers and was friendly and responded quickly to all our emails.  
The location is perfect for those that want a quiet neighborhood with plenty of walking options nearby for food, shopping, historic sites (just a few blocks from the start of the Freedom Trail) and a lovely walk to the river. Easy access to the T as well.  
We loved Boston and staying at Cindy's place made it one of the best weekend vacations we've ever enjoyed.  I would not hesitate to stay here again and again. "
528,"A beautiful apartment, well situated in the Back Bay close to shops, bars, restaurants and the ""T"".

The apartment is comfortable, clean and quiet - the perfect place to chill after a busy day in the city.

Marina is also an excellent host, with good communication before and during my stay.

Highly Recommended!"
529,"Avoid if your sensitive to cat dander or cigarette smoke. Room was clean, common area was... collegiate? Comfortable bed and hot shower with good water pressure. Tom answered my first call and was helpful."
530,"Laurie was a great host. Really nice and welcoming and had several leaflets ready for me to start planning my trip around the city.
Directions were really clear so I had no problem in finding the house.
The room is cosy and warm and the bathroom is amazing!
If you are flexible with your times and can work around Laurie's schedule this is a great place to stay."
531,"Staying with Lisa was truly an amazing experienece. She was very helpful whenever I asked for directions and she always had suggestions for places to visit. The transit passes were a plus!! The apartment was cozy and very clean and safe. Lisa keeps the home clean and with everything you could need during your visit, if I ever visit Boston again I would look into this bnb again without a doubt."
532,"Izzy was exceedingly kind and overly accommodating to my circumstances as I relocated to Boston.

The home in East Boston is a quick 5-minute walk to the [Blue Line] Airport T-station.  You can be in downtown Boston (financial district) within 10 minutes and in Cambridge within 25 mins (via Green/Red Line transfers).

Also important, the home is an easy 5-minute walk to a Shaw's Supermarket, Walgreen's and CVS pharmacies, Marshall's, a liquor store and LOTS of diverse restaurants and bakeries.

The room was of ample size, and the bed was very comfortable.  Important for me (as I was a 3-week rental), there was ample storage in both a large closet and 4-drawer bureau.  The room was also equipped with a small refrigerator.

The bathroom (also large) was shared with other guests -- and there was never a scheduling problem.  The other communal rooms -- kitchen and living room -- were large and comfortable, though my experience was that most guests stayed in their rooms when not out visiting Boston.

Much was done throughout my 3-week stay to ensure the communal areas of the home were clean and comfortable for me and the others guests.

I will always be grateful to Izzy for helping me with my relocation to Boston and for that was done to make my stay enjoyable and stress-free!!"
533,"Deborah was a great host. She has provided everything I need, gave me lots suggest on places to go, she also has provided some snack in our room which is very sweet.
 and their apartment is much bigger then you can see on the photo! The bed is very big and cozy, and the whole room is very comfortable.The apartment is very cloes to the blue line and walk distance to some park. Also can see the skyline near by."
534,"Super happy with my experience. The location was great, and Sean was nice. We did our own thing and came and went as we pleased without the worry of bothering anyone. Would definitely use again. "
535,"If you are looking for somewhere to stay in the Boston area then I urge you to look no further and STAY HERE at Jez and Ken's beautiful home. Yes it's a perfect stopover for the airport but it's also the perfect place to stay no matter how you arrive or intend to leave Boston. From the moment I made a provisional inquiry I found Jez and Ken attentive and full of useful info to help plan my trip. Their home is immaculate, well loved and exactly like the copious photos available on this site. My daughter and I felt privileged to stay there and were trebly blessed to have Shirley around too to make our stay all the more special. From the moment you arrive they will treat you as honoured guests for whom nothing is too much trouble. Breakfast was great (cereals, muffins, toast etc); our own shelf in the fridge was always stocked with orange juice, water and milk and they have a fantastic coffee machine and a selection of teas always available. We could have breakfast when it suited us which led to a very relaxed start to the day. We were also encouraged to use the kitchen, dining room and living room and felt very welcome when we did so.The shower mentioned is to die for and it would be worth booking with Jez and Ken's just to use it. DON'T BE PUT OFF BY ORIENT HEIGHTS SUBWAY STATION BEING TEMPORARILY CLOSED - we stayed with Jez and Ken for 9 nights and found it exceedingly easy, quick and cheap, to get in and out of Winthrop to central Boston and beyond. There's a bus stop just round the corner from the house or a shuttle bus will take you from Orient Heights to the next T Line stop. You could also take the scenic route and take the Winthrop Ferry to Downtown Boston. Jez and Ken are both hard-working and exceptionally busy but we were fortunate enough for Jez to offer to ferry us to the local supermarket and for Ken to have a little spare time which he graciously gave up to show us the sites. Having our own personal tour guide in Ken was fantastic and it was great to spend time with Shirley too. We can't thank you enough. Jez and Ken obviously enjoy meeting new people and take a genuine interest in what you get up to during your stay. Winthrop itself is beautiful and worth spending time in, whilst overlooking Downtown Boston, it's beautiful in its own right. The people are exceptionally friendly and travelling with a 16 year old girl I felt very safe there no matter what the time of day or night. Jez and Ken know the best places to eat: listen to them, we did and had a fantastic lobster meal just round the corner from their home. As you'll no doubt guess I loved my time there and can't wait to return. THANK YOU..."
536,"Jason and Stephanie were thoughtful and accommodating hosts. Their home is beautiful, the room is so comfortable, and (at least to me) it seems there's nothing one might need that they haven't anticipated. Every expectation I had was met, if not exceeded. I definitely recommend staying with them!"
537,"Great location, small space but everything you need. Clean too. Howard was super friendly and checking in was easy with the door keypad. "
538,"Great location and room! The bed was comfortable, the towels and the room were clean. The shower and the bathroom were also really nice - we really loved the shower in the bathroom - it's so big and warm. The process of checking in and out was very well explained and easy. 
The only thing that bothered us a little is that we could hear everything going on in the room next to us. I think the house was redesigned to be hotel-like so there used to be a door between these two rooms. Otherwise, a very pleasant experience, would totally recommend. "
539,"Just needed a place to lay my head for the night, and this was perfect for what I was looking for."
540,We felt the apt. was too minimally furnished and supplied given the daily fee paid.  The kitchen needs more equipment to cook comfortably. The apt. in general needs to be cleaner when guests arrive. There should be smoke detectors in every bedroom and a fire extinguisher should be supplied. These issues can be easily corrected.
541,"Cynthia and her family were very accommodating and we had a lovely stay at their place. The room was very cozy with private bathroom, and the location was very convenient. Everyone in the house was very nice to us and we enjoyed their company. It was a big pleasure to stay with them and we would highly recommend it! 
Some particular things about our stay that I would like to add. We always felt welcome. Breakfast in the morning was a great asset and I liked that I could cook eggs the way I want. But most importantly, I wanted to talk about the hosts  
Cynthia is a very caring and pleasant person. We really appreciated that she landed us a Charlie card when we did not know how to get it, found a coupon for my contact lenses solution when I suddenly ran out of it, and texted me when noticed we had left a light inside a car on.  She helped us save time and money which was very thoughtful and helpful since we came for just a couple of days and had a limited budget. We felt like we are not alone in this new city and someone actually cares about us. Hotels would never offer you that.  I think Cynthia went an extra mile for us because she has a big warm heart. You can tell that by looking at how all her family and guests love and appreciate her. 
P.S. It was super nice of Keith to make delicious scrambled eggs for us on our first morning!  This was a great icebreaker: he showed us the kitchen and explained everything; otherwise we might have been too shy to start cooking ourselves. Also, we really liked chatting with him. 
Also, the cat Lucy and the dog Izzy are very cute and added even more to the warm atmosphere in the house.
It was a great stay! My husband and me are very grateful for Cynthia<80><99>s, Keith<80><99>s and their family<80><99>s hospitality 3
"
542,"This was my first airbnb experience. I was greeted by Ahmed's assistant Eddie at the Panera Bread across the street, he took me over to the place and showed me around and made sure that I knew how to operate everything. He gave me his cell phone number and instructed me to text him if anything came up. Despite the age of the building, the studio apartment was quite clean (the hallways in the building are worn out looking, but that's nothing they can control and it is a 100 year old building. You just need to look past that). It's in the theater district of Boston and just down the street from Boston Commons. Lot's of places to eat nearby (Rock Bottom, Legal Seafoods, Subway, pizza joint, German food place, several pubs). The traffic outside can get noisy fairly early in the morning, so take that into consideration based on your sleeping habits.  I'm not a high-maintenance traveler and just need a place to sleep, take a shower, and check/respond to email. The apt. had internet access which had decent bandwidth speed. Compared to the costs of hotels ($279/night and up) in the area, I would not have any hesitations about staying here in the future. Thanks Eddie and Ahmed for hosting!"
543,"An excellent place to stay in the heart of Charlestown and just two minutes outside of downtown Boston.  Everything was exactly as advertised.  Beautifully appointed house with a parking spot, plenty of comfortable beds and hassle free coming and going.  I would definitely recommend Nicolo's home. A  first class experience all around!"
544,"Robert fue un gran anfitrión, me ayudó a planificar las visitas a la ciudad, es una persona muy amable y preocupada.

Su casa es muy acogedora, tiene una pieza amplia, y está bien ubicada (cercana al metro).

Definitivamente recomiendo alojarse con Robert.
"
545,"Both Christina and Drew were there to welcome me at the apartment.  They gave me a few great tips about where to eat locally and how to get around Boston.  The room faces onto the main road and is therefore quite noisy but I was given ear plugs and slept very well.  The room itself is small but as I was only there to sleep, I really didn't mind. The apartment was clean and tidy.  Also an additional thoughtful touch - Drew also wrote out a list of places to eat in Portland, Maine, which was my next destination, which is was really lovely and useful."
546,The Carneys were friendly and had a great place with comfy beds and nice decor. The availability of breakfast items was also a plus. Neighbourhood was beautiful and serene. Would come back here if possible.
547,"Meg's place has everything you want from a trip to Boston - a terrific and super-lovely host, a T station ten minutes away, ample air conditioning and a beautiful flat to relax in after a busy day. Also, there's Wally the schnauzer, who's so charming he could broker peace (website hidden) is a great neighbourhood, there are loads of cute cafes and good food places within walking distance, and it's very pretty. I only wish I could have stayed longer / forever. "
548,"Great hosts.  Everyone was friendly and very welcoming.  If you are fortunate enough to stay when they are having a party, even better.  Great central location if you need a room in Boston.  "
549,"The neigbourhood is excelent and the street is very nice and quiet.
the appartment is nice and the bedroom is  big and bright.
we didn't see john but his roommate was very nice.
Unfortunately, it was a bad experience,
the bed was very small, hard and skinny.
it was not enough big to sleep at two people, and we are tallest than the bed ( I am 6 feet tall).
My friend slept without sheets on the couch which was dirty also.
We have not taken a shower because the bathroom was seriously terrible with dirtiness and moldiness everywhere... I am sorry to tell that, but you can't rent at 100$ with these services. It is sad because you have everything to make a succes.
best regards,"
550,"Sean was a great host.The apartment was just the perfect place to (website hidden) has all we needed: cooking area, fridge and microwave came  in handy. Beds were ok and bathroom was fine. It was hot outside but the air conditioning worked well.Location is good, very close to T stop.Sean even lent us a car seat for our 2 year old daughter, so we are really grateful to him.Fab!!"
551,"Just like other reviews say - great location, friendly and accommodating host, affordable price. You might want to make a reservation ahead since this place is very popular!; also there are two rooms on his listing, so check out both of them for availability."
552,Andre Thomas was very helpful and informative. Thank you. 
553,"No quilt, no air conditioner. Very small. Good location, very close to Boston Conservatory. "
554,Amazing condo in an even better location! Donny & Chris went out of their way to make my first trip to Boston one that will keep me wanting to come back! 
555,"A beautiful apartment - we didn't meet the hosts but Phoebe their friend was a delight. She really made two VERY tired, weary travellers feel at home. 
The apartment is very spacious, the beds are so comfortable, and it is very warm! Parking is absolutely no problem, it's such a quiet, safe neighbourhood too. 
The wifi is REALLY fast - great as we were working. Only local TV but when you can stream, it doesn't matter :) Great kitchen, good power in the shower too. We had no difficulty driving around - and Wholefoods is just a short drive away too :) "
556,"Julie was out of town for the weekend but her roommate was able to help me out with everything. She was very nice and accommodating, I immediately felt welcomed in the apartment. The location was amazing, it was basically in the center of everything, and it was really nice to walk down Boylston and Newbury with all the shops. Even though there are several subways within walking distance, I didn't feel the need to take it when exploring all the way to the heart of downtown. It's even within a nice walking distance from the Esplanade along the river. Couldn't have asked for a better location. "
557,"Our hosts (Richard and Victoria) made us feel very welcome. They left detailed instructions for our stay, answered any questions we had,  and even left 2 bottles of wine for us to enjoy with our holiday dinners; such a thoughtful touch! They were just awesome; they kept in touch (via text messaging) to make sure that we were enjoying our stay and let us know they were available to immediately address any issue that may arise. The apartment was even better in person - super cute, clean, and comfy! It was also bigger than we thought it would be, with enough room for the 3 of us (me, my husband, and our adult son) to spend time together, but also for each of us to have our own space if desired. The apt had all the described amenities (2 flat-screen TVs, wireless internet, a fully-supplied kitchen, etc.). We all slept well; the beds were big, soft, and warm. The neighborhood was nice, very quiet with a suburban feel. This was our first experience with airbnb, and the bar has been set very high indeed! This was sooo much better than staying in a hotel. The apartment was absolutely perfect - literally a home away from home. We would stay there again in a heartbeat."
558,"Kamal was very welcoming  and pleasant gentleman when we arrived at his place. You feel very comfortable in company of the host. He is very helpful in answering  any queries about the area around. 
We had complete access to the fully equipped kitchen and laundry. We had our  own privacy . Their kitty and we became very friendly during this period.
The location is perfect for  public transportation  and it is 15-20 mins walk to downtown , if you love to walk. 
We stayed here for 6 weeks and would come back here again if I come to Boston.

"
559,"Steve is the best host ever! My friend and I went to Boston and stayed there for a few days, whenever we wanted to ask something, we always got prompt responses, and he told us a good restaurant around there which we ended up going 2 days in a row! The place was very clean and in a safe and quiet neighborhood. Steve was a very warm, friendly and welcoming person. I definitely recommend Steve's place for your stay in Boston!"
560,"We stayed at Carlos and Cheryl's 2 bedroom condo in Boston for the 2015 Marathon. My boyfriend was running, and our moms came along for the trip.

The space:
This apartment is small, but fit our needs completely. It was great to have a ""home away from home"" as our home base, rather than a hotel, as it was crucial to be able to control our runner's diet prior to race day. The place had plenty of common space in the kitchen and the living room, and there was wifi and cable TV to enjoy when not partaking in local activities.

The neighborhood:
The North End was a FANTASTIC place to stay. It was central to many of the major landmarks in the city, plus it had access to two major T stops. The food was around the apartment was fantastic (Giacomo's is 1 block away and worth the wait!), and you are walking distance to the Freedom Trail.

The hosts:
Not only did they contact me almost immediately upon accepting the reservation, they shared important information about the area, the apartment, and their method for distributing keys. They also reached out 2 weeks prior with more stay details and checked-in the day we arrived.

Overall, an excellent experience. I hope to stay here again on my next trip to the city!"
561,"Hi, everything went very well. Check-In was just perfect. The shared bathrooms were always clean and I only had to wait once for about 10 minutes to use it during my week long stay. The street was quiet most of the time and the location is just gorgeous. And having the Whole Foods Market just 2 minutes walk away is also a big plus. The only downside was the overall slow WIFI speed."
562,"Jeff was easy to reach and very responsive to our emails and texts. He was responsible and trustworthy, doing what he said he would do, and being there when he said he would be. Nice neighborhood, right on the bus line to downtown. Jeff showed us where we were on the map, and how to get where we were going. He was helpful, and gave us all the information and help that we needed. We felt welcomed and comfortable. Thank you very much."
563,"Hermina provided us a place to stay on very short notice. I e-mailed her the day prior, and she opened up the process for me to book a room at her home for two nights. When we arrived, she provided a way to get into the house, a clean room and bed, and bathroom. She even allowed us to steal some of the fridge for holding some food and let us eat some of her breakfast fixings. It was a pleasure to stay there for 2 nights. If we ever return to Boston, we'll definitely be contacting her! Also worth noting - we had a car and parking was not an issue at all. Lastly, the T Station is VERY close - a 5 minute walk if you take your time. All in all - a great accommodation!"
564,"Pretty much as described. It was easy to find when driving and there was plentiful on street parking. The building appears to be a late 19th/early 20th century house, of which the apartment makes up the ground floor. The room is the former front room, the kitchen and bathroom are shared with Liz and Lucian. Liz and Lucian were very welcoming and understanding of our late arrival. The room is of reasonable size, probably best suited to a couple travelling although we fit three adults in there with little difficulty.

The building is about 10-15 minutes from the subway station, a further 20 minutes on the train to central Boston.

We enjoyed our stay and the opportunity it gave to explore Boston."
565,"Hermina is a wonderful host, and it really is like staying with a friend. She is 100% relaxed and generous: letting us share food from the fridge, borrow her GPS, even giving up her own room. A perfect stay!"
566,"Had a great time in Boston. The house was great, had everything we needed. Particularly liked the communal areas that were available, and loved having breakfast on the outdoor terrace upstairs. "
567,Had a good stay here. Was close to trains. Ideal for a couple.
568,Nice Apt.！Convienient，comfortable and cleaning～Just a few minutes to the Red line T public transportation. We sleep well with two beds in separate rooms and enjoy a great stay here.Maybe at the very first we have a little trouble to get in the apt. because of poor English but Jay's response is quick. Best recommendation ! 波士顿大好，住宿棒棒哒，干净，交通方便，还可以煮个拉面，力荐！
569,"We were in Boston for only 3 nights, and Susan's place was the perfect place for us. It is within 2 minutes from the T, and from there you can travel easily to anywhere in Boston. Susan was also a gracious host and made sure we had everything we needed and had some great ideas about places to see and eat. She is also quite the cook and every morning we were treated to Susan's home baking, cooked fresh along with an assortment of other breakfast items. The bedroom and bathroom were both spacious and clean, and it really felt like a home away from home. If you want to visit Boston, then we would wholeheartedly recommend Susan's place."
570,"All of my experiences with AirBnB have been easy and fun, and this one was too. 

I called John about 30 minutes before I arrived and he was waiting for me at the door to the building. He gave me a quick review of access to the building and showed me around the apartment. The location is about as central as you can get to downtown Boston. There is a T stop immediately below the building so you can get anywhere quickly. There are plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, and retail stores right in the area. China Town, the North End, and the Boston Common are short walks away from the apartment. 

The apartment itself was nice, with three comfortable bedrooms and a nice living/dining room combination. The bathroom was comfortable, clean, and had a huge jetted tub. I didn't get to try the jacuzzi out, but it looked nice. The shower was hot and had great pressure. I took the back bedroom and was surprised at how quiet it was. My coworkers indicated that there was some street noise from construction next door, but they both indicated it wasn't a problem. 

Afterwards we agreed that we would definitely stay here again. Thanks Jon!"
571,"We had a wonderful stay at Alicia and Kostas' place. The house is beautiful, welcoming and hospitable. The hosts are wonderful people, we felt like we've met old friends. We had morning coffee with them and shared our life stories in the beautiful yard under a grapevine canopy. The entire neighborhood is charming, close to the train and lots of good restaurants. We walked back from watching the 4th of July fireworks at midnight and felt safe. 
 Thank you very much, Alicia and Kostas for the great place to stay and the best memories."
572,"Erik and Traci were absolutely wonderful hosts and made me feel right at home in this quiet area of Cambridge.  The apartment is a straight shot to Harvard square and walking distance of the T (easy to get anywhere in Boston).  Erik and Traci were also knowledgeable of Boston and the immediate area around their home and were able to give valuable input as I looked for an apartment for my wife and I.  

The area around Erik and Traci is extremely quiet and safe, with lots of families in the area.  Their house was extremely clean and well kept.  It was a pleasure staying with them and I would highly recommend them to anyone."
573,Susans apartment is in a great location. Walking distance to downtown and some nice bars and restaurants. Communication and check in was easy and great. Would stay here again when visiting Boston.
574,"Amanda and Sara were both friendly and accommodating with checkin and checkout times, which really helped me out. Room was very comfortable (somewhat undersold in the pictures), for instance; coffee machine, en suite , tv entertainment . Great stay "
575,We went to boston for three days vacation. Living in Steve's place is very convenient and cheap. we save a lot money on this vacation.
576,"What a delightful experience staying at Bruce and Berry's home. I found the experience to be everything they said. They were warm and welcoming, got me situated in the house, made sure the temperature in my room was cool enough during the hot summer day. The room itself was beautiful and the house was unique and enjoyable. 
In the morning I was able to meet other people who were staying there as well as have a nice conversation with Berry. The neighborhood seemed very safe and it was a short walk from the T station.
Overall- a very lovely experience! "
577,"We loved staying at Robert's house. He was an excellent host, took us for a guided tour of Jamiaca Plain when we arrived and made us feel at home. The house is just like it looks online, and is very nice. There are lots of stairs, but they're not a big deal. It was really nice to have our own bathroom and his dog is also very friendly. We did most of our traveling around Boston on the train and the local T stop was an easy walk, plus trains run regularly. The local shops stock mostly organic food and are a bit pricey but it's a very welcoming neighbourhood. Would recommend anyone to go and stay there. Thanks Robert for a great stay."
578,This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was wonderful.  The owners were easy to get in touch with from the initial reservation through the last day.  The apartment was in a great location for any Boston experience.  I highly recommend them for anyone traveling to the area.
579,"This place is a great option for the busy and hectic business traveler who enjoys a minimalistic, modern, industrial loft feel.

I was traveling to the Cambridge area for business for two days and one night. I usually go the hotel route when I have a full meeting schedule because the key exchange can often be a hassle.  However, Juan was completely flexible, when I had a gap in my schedule, I was able to duck out and pick up the keys on 10 minutes notice.  Key drop off was just as easy and flexible.  

The building is very new and there are several other very recent high rise condos and apartments within a couple blocks, so there is a bustling level of activity.  Definitely a younger mid 20s to early 40s type of neighborhood.  Close enough to the main Cambridge office area (~1 mile) that you could walk, or it's less than $7 for an UberX ride.  I took a total of 3 rides from the condo, and the wait times were 2,2, and 3 minutes, so not bad at all for a residential area.

A few tips for future occupants: 
I had some slight concern given its proximity to the highway and trains at the time of booking, but the condo windows are very well insulated and they were a complete non-issue.  Nothing to worry about at all.

The shower head turns almost 360 degrees counter-clockwise to get hot water.  The temperature label  on the shower nozzle could be interpreted as it being a 90 degree turn.  It took about 30 seconds of me waiting for hot water to figure that one out!

I also noticed that Juan had an airbed on the couch, so  it appears the place could accommodate additional folks if necessary. 






"
580,"Bruce was not available, so we were hosted by Barry who was incredibly welcoming and warm. The house is simply gorgeous and very cleanly maintained. The house is about 0.5 miles from the MBTA train station, so very convenient. There was complimentary breakfast available and Barry came down during breakfast time and made sure we were comfortable. 

All in all, Bruce and Barry made sure that our first trip to Boston was memorable. I would definitely recommend their listing to anyone planning on visiting Boston."
581,"Afiyah is a great host. The room was clean and cozy. You can even enjoy a small breakfast buffet. ( coffee, tea, milk, jam, peanut butter, cereals, fresh fruit, bagels) Its set up the whole day, so when you arrive late, you can have a small snack before going to bed. Its short walking distance to the T station Orient Heights, 8 min walk. Taxi to airport about 12 USD. 
The House is located at a small bay across the airport. Since the airport is so close there is some noise from departing/ landing aircrafts. But it didnt annoy me at all, had a good night sleep."
582,"Our first Airbnb experience couldn't have gone better! Jason is the perfect host. From our initial email introduction, several months prior to our arrival, to the follow up during our stay, Jason ensured that we had everything we needed. The apartment is conveniently located near Boston University and Newbury Street and had everything we (along with our two year old) could've asked for (Disney on directv and Netflix.. Jackpot for the little!) This place is our new home away from home in Boston. We will be back for sure!!"
583,Edward was very helpful and responded to any questions that I had within hours. The studio looked exactly as what shown in the pictures - I love the lightening! It was a great experience! Thanks : ) ! 
584,"The host was responsive during our stay and he made sure we had everything we needed. The apartment is modern and perfectly located in Beacon hill with good access to metro, sights and supermarket.  Even though the apartment is quite small it was good enough for me and my husband and we really enjoyed our stay. "
585,Great location! Apartment is clean and comfortable. Great place for the price. Definitely recommend. 
586,"A very cozy, cute space in a great location, especially for convention goers!  Restaurants and other shopping close by, within a short walk....the apartment has an especially comfy bed.  Kate, the host, is delightful and will do her best to make your stay an enjoyable one."
587,"I enjoyed my stay at Hermina's house. The room nice and comfortable.
The train connection to Boston metro area was great. The host was very nice, helpful and hospitable.

Olga"
588,"Great place to stay in Boston... The studio is rignt on Beacon Hill and ten minutes walk from the sea !! Henri and Lisa were very nice and helpful. 

The view on the top on the building is just thrilling !! You can enjoy a beer on a sunset over the golden dome of Massachussett's State House !!

It was a really nice time, and we recommend it to everyone ! "
589,"I stayed at Ari's for two nights and everything was perfect. I actually did not meet Ari, I met his mum, who was super kind and helpful, but Ari emailed me to make sure everything was OK. The room was exactly the same as described, it was very clean, the bed is super-comfy, the kitchen has all you could possibly need, I loved everything about Ari's place! Also, the location is great, it's a very quiet neighborhood, but it has all you need! The Walgreens is just across the street, as well as the coffee shop and some cute restaurants. The bus station to Harvard Square is just steps away from Ari's house. I highly recommend Ari's place to anyone coming to Boston/Cambridge and I will most definitely stay with Ari on my next visit."
590,Jason answered my emails and phone call promptly. The location was terrific but some neighbors were noisy. Comfortable apartment.
591,Kitty from Seamless was a great host. Stayed at The Kensington. Great facility and location. The property is new and has great amenities. The apartment was well fitted with everything needed and had great views. Located about a block from 2 different T stops and a short walk to South Station made this property ideal.
592,"In real estate it is all about location.  You can't beat this address.  Truly walking distance from food, sights and transportation.  I even walked back from Fenway Park after the Red Sox forgot how to play baseball on July 28, 2015.  Still, it was a fabulous time.  92 Beacon St. is a great value for lodging.  The only hiccup was a Comcast Cable Box failure which Joseph was ""Johnny on the spot"" about resolving.  Didn't bother me, I was there to see Boston.  I forwarded my thoughts to family and friends, so they too can cash in on this value.  Thanks JW, I had a great time in Baaahston!"
593,Bill was amazing. His apartment is immaculate and has beautiful huge windows with such a beautiful view of wooded area close to subway which was perfect. Bill is a great chef and made me two scrumptious breakfasts. Look forward to returning soon. 
594,"The apartment was exactly what we needed for our trip to Boston. The rooms were big enough to make it feel like home,  the kitchen was great,  and being able to do our laundry,  iron our clothes,  and relax between conference outings made it a steal at the price. 

The only downsides were a weak wifi connection and the daily construction every morning at 8am, but the latter I'm sure is just part of living in the city. 

Thanks Liesel for all your help while we were there."
595,It's a lovely little apartment. Jose was always available and took care of few issues that came up during our stay. We enjoyed the convenient location right in the middle of charming restaurants and short walk to anywhere in Downtown Boston. 
596,Excellent apt! Very well kept! 
597,"Everything about our stay was wonderful.  The location is fantastic and the room is pleasant.  The separate entrance was nice, and the shared bathroom worked well.  Gerald's home has really fun decorations and tons of character.  He also gave us truly wonderful recommendations for places to eat - he knows where to go!  Skye was also a lot of fun."
598,"This apartment is beautiful! Exactly as advertised and it's in perfect conditions. I had the opportunity to talk to Edward a couple of times and he is a very kind person who likes to take good care of the place. I received very detailed instructions to check-in the apartment and everything worked great, the security is excellent. Also, the area is beautiful and has  lots of restaurants. 

I recommend this place 100% and I look forward to stay there in the future. "
599,"Had a short and wonderful stay, the location was incredible and the room was exactly what I was looking for. "
600,"We spent 5 nights in Sanjay's appartement. For the two of us it had the perfect size. We could have spent much more days there! All in all a really modern, quiet and clean apartment. "
601,John was a wonderful host and made us feel very welcomed. The location was convenient and the accommodations were exactly as described.  Highly recommend John's West Roxbury estate.  
602,"Tiffany was an extremely gracious and communicative host; she was very accommodating and made us feel very welcome. The house had everything you could need during a trip and Tiffany even left us snacks, pizza and wine!

We truly enjoyed the home and had a great time. I would highly recommend this as a unique way to experience Boston. "
603,"Jon was always very responsive and accommodating.  Self check-in was very easy; Jon got up very early in the morning to buzz us in from his cell phone.  The location was fantastic, next door to the Downtown Crossing subway stop and walking distance from Quincy Market.  The place was very clean, all of the appliances worked, and the internet was fast.  Also, the tub in the bathroom has jacuzzi jets.  "
604,It was a great experience staying here. Ella and Will were so accommodating and friendly. It was wonderful to have the entire apartment.
605,Anthony was very good and communication and helpful with check in and out. Didn't actually met him. The people in the property we very friendly although didn't speak English. The room was spotless and had air con. Location was perfect less than 5 min walk to subway so really easy to get into centre and some really nice restaurants close by. The road noise didn't bother us at all.
606,"We had a great time staying at Quinn-May's place. The room was very nice and clean; the bathroom, shared between several rooms, was also clean. There is cheap parking ($5/day) just around the corner, at the T station."
607,Keith was very helpful in coordinating my stay. The neighborhood was a classic Boston spot full of charm. Easy enough to get there and lay my weary head.
608,"The appartment is a comfortable, quiet and very convenient place for a stay in Boston ! You have a supermarket about 5 min by walking and it's pretty easy to park a car near the place. Subway is very close, about 5-10 min by walking and after that, you're in the city center in 10 min. But you can also do the Freedom Trail : it's a walking path which make you discover the city of Boston by going through historical monuments ! And it starts right next to the appartment !
Finally, Rachel and Nate are very welcoming and kind people ! They take care of you and your comfort. They were easily available before our arrival and at any time during our stay.
We highly recommand these hosts and their appartment !"
609,"Kelly is a five star host. Unflappable (and I offered some very good reasons to flap!) and very warm spirited. The apt is chic, neat and cosy plus has the biggest tv I ever saw in my life! The area is very buzzy and full of excellent non-chain restaurants. Thoroughly recommended, particularly the lovely hosts. Thanks Kelly"
610,"We didn<b4>t meet Izzy at all!!!! After we arrived nobody was there except some spanish speaking people.
Our room was disgusting!!! It smelted like mold and was very dirty!!!!
The Bathroom wasn<b4>t cleaned either and my friend and i wanted to leave right after we came<80><a6>
The Dryer or washer was not usable because the assistant from Izzy washed all the time.
The Neighborhood is not safe at all and every other morning u could hear people fight.
Don<b4>t stay there!!!!!! It<b4>s nothing like u would expect it! 
And it<b4>s defenetly to expensive for this nasty place!!!! "
611,"Rafael was very pleasant and communicative, he met us at the door, and everything went very smoothly.  The apartment is very clean and pleasant and in a very nice neighborhood.  The bed is super comfortable!  We had a great night's sleep. I would definitely stay here again.  "
612,"The place was clean and easy to get to from the station. It's really close to the red line and a highway so it's a little noisy but besides that everything was great. If I need to stay in Boston again, I'm definitely choosing this place. "
613,"We had a fantastic stay in Paolo's studio apartment. Great location, close to everything wonderful about the North End! The apartment was very clean and equipped in a quiet apartment building with friendly neighbours. Lots of wonderful light. The apartment sleeps four comfortably, if you are OK with sleeping in close quarters, which worked for us! Shout out to Ralph, who met us as soon as we arrived and was very helpful during our stay. Great experience. We'll be back."
614,"Staying Robert's place was my first attempt to use airbnb.
I had great stay in Boston. Robert is a great host. The room is very comfortable, clean, and beautiful. Location can't be better!!
I would love to come back his place If I have chance to come Boston again.
Thanks Robert!"
615,"This apartment was exactly what I was looking for. The pictures are exactly as it appears and the location cannot be beat. 

Hanover Street is right in the heart of Little Italy, one of the oldest, neighborhoods and all of Boston. 

The cost was very comparable when you consider the amenities you get and the location especially when comparing it to any one of the hotels in the area that can cost up to $600 dollars a night.  

I definitely will be back and look forward to staying here again."
616,"We had a lovely time in Boston. The house was fantastic and spacious for 5. It is the first time we had planned a trip and had gone ahead with booking place to stay using Airbnb, and I should say I got a brilliant place to stay 
Thank You Jack for letting us stay at your beautiful home. 

Regards
Vignesh Ramji"
617,"Very good stay, unfortunately too short (only two nights). The house is special and eco-friendly, the room was enough clean and everything was as we expected. Positive aspects: large and bright room, private entrance, good, healthy biological breakfast, organic soaps, large shower stall. Negative aspects: very small washbasin. Andree is a good host, she was very helpful and kind. The neighborhood is very nice and quite, a little bit far from downtown Boston but no problem to reach it by bus, metro or car. Thank you Andree, I would suggest your peculiar house to everyone!"
618,"Jane's house is very beautiful and quiet. My family felt very comfortable living in her house, sometimes I felt that I came back to my hometown. We are grateful to her and her parents for helping us settle down in Boston. Especially, we are glad to share our similar travel story with each other. It is amazing that they can speak English, Chinese and Japanese and welcome guests from all over the world. "
619,"Had an awesome time! It's REALLY close to the T, clean, and in a very ""New England"" part of time. Reminded me of my home growing up. :-)"
620,"Before i say anything else i would like to talk about the host-Giuseppe. He is one damn helpful guy and is very responsive, who is always just a call away if you need any help. I was from abroad and it was my first trip to boston but i hardly faced any difficulty thanks to some really helpful advice from Giuseppe regarding the places, transport, restaurants etc. Talking about the room, it is pretty much the same what you read in the description. It has a private toilet(not bath) and a sink. The bed was very comfortable and i got some clean linen and blankets too. You dont get any furniture apart from the bed like a table or a chair and as said earlier its a pretty small room. The other room mates are quiet and are usually very busy, so don't be surprised if you are in the house all by yourself most of the times. Talking about the location- it has numerous restaurants which are just a couple of mins walk from home in brighton ave. There are a lot of places to eat and drink nearby. As far as transportation is concerned the nearest bus stops are just 5 minutes away by walking and as a student i had to go to longwood medical area everyday and had no difficulty doing it whatsoever. All in all the room and location were great and i had zero issues during 1 month of stay. I would recommend this to all those who are looking for a cheap accommodation in a safe and a happening location."
621,"Had a good time at Lisa's place,amazing and humble (website hidden) was also easy to get to the subway via the bus(bus stop is just in front of the house).
Room was nice and warm during the winter(Good heating system in the room).The floor boards can be cold at times,so it'll be a good idea to bring some indoor slip on's during the cold months.
Overall a great stay and would be happy to come back!!"
622,"Jim was very welcoming.
My flight got delayed but he was very accommodating to the time change. He also gave me some advises on places to grab a bite."
623,"Except for the location, an overall disappointing experience. The  apartment is older and in worse condition than the description and photos seem to show. Note that it's on a 3rd floor with no lift, there's no TV, internet is available through a weak Mifi device, it's very noisy outside (ie. provided earplugs!), etc. "
624,"+ Excellent location in terms of subway and accessibility.
+ Lily and Harry were very nice, and got us into the apartment very easily.
+ Pretty nice apartment, room was reasonable size though not huge (full size bed).
+ Hosts were considerate and quiet"
625,"My stay was brief but very pleasant! The apartment was cozy and clean, and the bay windows in my room added extra cheer. Soledad is a wonderfully gracious person, and fascinating in conversation. The place has my highest recommendations."
626,We felt like at home!!! We suggest Amy's house to everyone is planning a journey in Boston!
627,"We really enjoyed staying at Lisa and Brian's place. They make it very cosy for their guests. The room has some books that can give you great information on Boston, and they are also very helpful in suggesting restaurants or points of interest. The Bed was fantastic! Slept like a baby. The free public transportation passes are a huge plus. The other thing I really liked was the breakfast in the morning. Lisa is interested in starting a B&B in the future, and based on our stay, I'm sure it will be a success. Will come here for another stay in Boston."
628,"Nicole is the perfect host. She served me Brazlian coffee when I arrived and it was served in a very beautiful way. The room was cleanly and had lot of lighting. The house is decorated with pieces of art scattered art while give it a very nice feel. She has a cat named Sasha, who actually owns the house. I bonded well with her. Nicole tries to spend time and talk with you despite her busy schedule. It was a wonderful experience and I wish I could have stayed longer."
629,Rachel's place is incredible all around! It is stylish and comfortable. My wife and I went for a valentines weekend in the city and had an incredible time. The location is a perfect hub for shopping and dining. It is hard to imagine a better deal in the city!
630,"We strongly recommend patty&javier's house. They were really kind, what you get is what you see in the ad. Confortable room with private toilet. The only 'but' is the distance from downtown, too big for tourists as us. But is perfectly connected by train.

The area is nice too, quite, mostly residential, perfect for vegan people.

"
631,"Lisa was a great host ,friendly and helpful. Room was clean and big enough. It was great stay in Boston.
highly recommend."
632,Liam is just plain good (GREAT) people. Stay. With. Him. 
633,"Marlo's place was great.  We loved the proximity to all we were interested in and walked or ran everywhere.  We rarely took public transportation.
Marlo was always ready to suggest places to go and things to do, but we ran out of time. 
If anyone chooses to go to Boston, stay a week or more.  It's wonderful."
634,"Soledad is a wonderful, friendly host.  She is very efficient and takes her guests satisfaction very seriously.  The room is small but very adequate for one person.  The bed was comfy.  There are 4 large windows so it does not feel closed in.  The usable desk is a nice plus.  The apartment is spotlessly clean with a nice kitchen.  I felt very safe parking my car and walking to the MBTA.  Bottom line, nice room, free parking, $30 per night, Boston.  Hard to go wrong.  I will stay again on my next trip.  Thank you Soledad!
Gwen"
635,"Adam and Rachel are very warm and thoughtful hosts. They packed us apples and fruit bars for us to have on the go. And they made us breakfast and coffee everyday. Their dog, Lucy, is very friendly too."
636,"Susan met me at the train station and made me feel welcome throughout my stay. She's was great conversation and company, as was her cat Shuki.

Good price, very reliable internet, and plenty of fresh fruit. I would stay here again (and may do)."
637,"The apartment is near South Boston, extremely close to the Andrew T stop on the Red Line, which makes it very convenient for getting around the city. The check-in and out procedures were very easy and Shawn was prompt and easy to communicate with."
638,"Katy's apartment ended up being the perfect place for me to stay for a night in Boston. I was in a wedding in Brookline, and the apartment was a short drive away. The room is simple and clean, with a great collection of Boston guides for those not familiar with the city. Katy's partner even dropped off some fresh scones for breakfast. Much appreciated! Since I was only there for a quick night, I unfortunately never met Katy--but her partner was very welcoming! The only problem I had was with parking. During the day it was a non-issue, but at night I drove around for 30 mins in the rain trying to find a spot. It was frustrating, but that's Boston. It was also a good reminder that you're better off leaving your car outside of the city and taking the T!"
639,"Was definitely Alittle weary about staying in someone's house whom I've never met, but Kristine made us feel like we've known her forever.  Her house was beautiful, the location was great, and the bed comfortable. I would definitely recommend Kristina's place. "
640,We had a terrific time there! A great place to stay in Boston.
641,"Steven is a great host. I loved the place, it has been one of my top  Airbnb experiences by now. It was a few minutes away from the red line and I will choose it again if I have the opportunity. "
642,"We had the most amazing time while our stay in Boston.  The house was more then the pictures and other reviews wrote about.  Thomas and Jenny are great hosts who answered all our questions.  The house is very clean and a great place to stay that is a quick drive to the city.

Would surely stay here again if we ever go back to Boston and would recommend the house to our friends."
643,"We had a lovely stay in Susan's beautiful Victorian townhouse! Susan is a wonderful host and bakes delicious cakes for breakfast. We also loved Susan's adorable puppy, Zoe. The house is so close to a red T line station and it was extremely easy to get into the city centre. Everything was really clean and comfortable! Thank you Susan!"
644,"Very nice place at an excellent neighborhood, close to the Boston Common and the T. It was exactly as pictured in the website, cozy and clean. The door code system was easy to use and very convenient. Would definitely stay there again. Highly recommended."
645,"Sasha was a very accommodating and kind host. The room and house were both well taken care of and comfortable. The bathroom is actually shared with the room on the 3rd floor because it is in their room. Luckily, it was never hard to make arrangements with the others guests staying in that room."
646,The host canceled this reservation 27 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
647,My mom and I had a great stay at Leah's apartment.  It was close to downtown JP and easy to get in and out of.  The apartment is fun and tidy.  
648,"We enjoyed our stay at Frank's place. Frank is a terrific host and it was a pleasure getting to know him a little.  The place is exactly as advertised. Nice large room, clean and well maintained with comfortable beds. Having parking available is a big plus if you are driving.  The location is safe and private and it is not difficult to go to Cambridge or to downtown Boston if you want to drive there. Taking public transportation requires a bit more effort since you need to take a bus to the nearest T station.  Again - driving from here to the other places was easy and it was nice to know that parking was available when you returned.  Frank was very flexible and we enjoyed getting to know him."
649,"Great place, great location, away from city core but close to T and Sam Adams Brewery. Easy ride to core on the T. Host was able to respond to broken shower hose immediately even though she was away from the house. "
650,The reservation was canceled 26 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
651,"Jessica's enchanting Oasis was even better than expected. The photos are beautiful but reality does not do them justice, you really have to be there. The beds were super comfortable, the house very clean (smells amazing!). Jessica has a talent for interior decorating. Her carriage house is a warm and welcoming place to relax after touring the sites. Waking up to a yummy breakfast and gourmet coffee tops the list; especially when you can enjoy it on her sunny terrace.
The location was perfect.  It was easy to get around in order to visit all the hot spots in Boston. A 10 minute walk to the T train red line which will take you everywhere you want to go. 
It was everything we were looking for and more."
652,"Great room, in a very convenient, central part of town, and close to the T Orange line. Air conditioning was a life saver on a hot weekend. The massage chair was so nice after a long day of walking. Howard provides all kinds of hotel-like amenities <80><94> full set of towels, toiletries, umbrella, maps, extra pillows and blankets, and most importantly, a bathroom all to ourselves. Thanks so much!"
653,"Jessica's house is just beautiful. Wide spaces, clean, well equipped, it had everything we expected.
The neighborhood is nice and safe and public transportations are close.
Jessica is a great host, available and helpful; we really loved dealing with her.
I can only recommend this place if you're visiting Boston."
654,"The property was furnished & as described.  They did do us a favor & got us into the unit to drop off our luggage earlier than check in so that we could enjoy the sites before we took occupancy, thank you very much for that.

The check in procedure was slightly difficult due to the lockbox code/lockbox not functioning properly.  There was only one set of key's left, so when we were let in by the apartment managers we still did not have keys to access the property.  I cannot say that Churchill was not pleasant to deal with on all occasions, because they were.  The hassle was the fact that things were not as they should have been.  The unit did need some maintenance that was deferred as well.  Overall, we loved the place, dealing with Churchill was not bad, & dealing with the property's on site apartment management was pleasant as well.  Would we recommend it, yes I would, but I would be aware that the emergency line you have to call can have you waiting a little bit for them to get back to you.  They do always get back to you, but it does take time."
655,Izzy was a nice and helpful host with detailed directions. The room is in the basement and even though Izzy mentions it we somehow missed that detail and it has narrow stairs leading down to it which made it hard for us to carry our bags up and down. We are unfortunately traveling with really heavy bags. The place is in East Boston and is extremely convenient for the airport.
656,Jason was an excellent host. I booked for a sofa bed but he let me stay in another room with a real bed because it was available. I really appreciate it. The place was tidy and spacious. The location is perfect since it's very close to the train station. :)
657,"Marguerite is a wonderful hostess.  She truly cares about her guests, and is interested in getting to know them, which is one aspect which sets AirBnB apart from a hotel.  My room was quiet, comfortable, and I much appreciated the private bathroom!  I had a fantastic stay!"
658,Katy's house is beautiful and she has clearly worked hard to make it easy to be her guest. She has a user manual with everything you need to know for your stay. We were grateful for the comfortable place for our family of five.
659,"This place is the perfect location to explore Boston. In the heart of little Italy and a 10 min walk to the T (their public transportation). Howard was very nice and gave us plenty of great recommendations. He was quick to respond and his place was very clean! Whatever toiletries we had forgotten, he already has. He checked up on us on the first day, the day after the first and the last day. Can't wait to stay at his place again whenever we visit Boston again."
660,"The apartment was so perfectly located and cozy, I want to keep it a secret and keep it all for myself...

Kim was a very kind and organized host, she gave me a lot of different recommendations and tips.

I know you'll love the place. "
661,Excellent accommodation in a great location! The apartment is larger than it looks in photos - with all the amenities you could need and very comfortable beds. It is a short walk to the T station with easy access all over town. The JP neighborhood itself is fun to explore and our lovely hosts gave us great suggestions for local places to check out.  I would definitely recommend this place to others!!
662,Kida is a great hostess! Her space is quiet and decorated in a really cool way. High ceilings and a view of the ballpark are a plus. I highly recommend her space!
663,"I had a wonderful stay--I was there for 5 weeks and building was clean and quiet.  Great stay, very helpful if I needed anything.  Its an amazing location in the heart of Beacon Hill.  "
664,Andy was a great host and accommodated my parents busy schedule who were traveling to Boston to help move me into my new apartment.  The apartment was very clean and Andy's father helped to straighten out my parents parking situation since our van couldn't fit in the garage (parking space).  Thanks Andy!
665,We couldn't have found a more perfect apartment for our 4 night stay in Boston for my graduation. The location is absolutely perfect  between Salem St. & Hanover St. North Bennett Court is tucked away & we couldn't believe how quiet and peaceful it was. The beds were comfortable and the apartment had everything that we needed. The communication was quick and efficient and couldn't have been easier. I would stay here again and again. I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking for an authentic North End experience. The stairs are steep so if you have mobility issues then this is not the right place for you. Thanks again Dror!
666,Clement was extremely nice and I felt very welcome  at his home. His apartment was clean and cozy - I would definitely stay here again!
667,"We had a great stay at Megan & Chris's place. Jamaica Plain is a nice neighbourhood: leafy trees, beautiful mansions and a huge pond, coffee bars and restaurants at the end of their street, and a very local, do-it-together attitude. Much nicer than one might expect after the metro ride, which takes a little less than half an hour from/to downtown. The apartment is a real travellers place, with maps and pictures from all over the world. Cosy and colourful and very clean. The room isn't very big but has a nice private porch and airconditioning. The bed is on the narrow side but that didn't bother us. We didn't see much of Megan and Chris, but we did meet them early on and they gave us a lot of fun and interesting tips."
668,This place is very spacious and everything is great ! It is located at a quiet and nice neighborhood with lots of good restaurant. There are some meter parking available on the street. Very happy with the entire experience and much thanks to Kevin who showed us the place. 
669,For my first airbnb experience staying at Jair's place was great. He was very helpful and responsive. The flat was great. 
670,Thank you for the wonderful time at your place. Lisa and her husband are friendly hosts. The room was great and also our baby felt great. I would always come back to you!
671,A fantastic experience in a truly beautiful part of Boston. Tuomas left us clear instructions of how to get into the apartment and got back to us quickly if we needed to ask him anything. I would definitely stay here again if I ever came to Boston. Paramount is a great restaurant for breakfast and it's not too far away.
672,"Great time with great hosts!  Homey environment and friendly cat.  Sally and Bruce were engaging and very generous- they even gave us a ride to the train station when we were in a pinch!  Whole Foods is right around the corner, so all of your food needs are easily met.  Restaurants are within walking distance.  The ""T"" is just a few blocks away and can zip you to other nearby shopping/restaurant hubs as well.  Easy 20 minutes on the T to the Back Bay, Boston Commons. The financial district and the North End are just a few stops farther.  Good overall location, slightly removed from the hustle and bustle, quiet at night, great hosts. "
673,"I stayed with Ali for almost two months during a research visit at Boston College. 

He was an amazing host, who showed me around, was always very helpful and introduced me to a lot of nice people. As a roommate he is very considerate and although we both had our schedules we often shared dinner and since we have a lot of common interests, we had many great discussions. I think it is fair to say, that I also found a friend in Ali.

The appartment is tidy and clean, very bright and with all kinds of amenities. The neighborhood is quiet and friendly and most importantly in walking distance to BC. There is a lake close by, which is nice for running. Restaurants and a great coffee place are in walking distance.

I would recommend it without any hesiation."
674,"Beacon  Hill is a wonderful neighborhood.  We thoroughly enjoyed being within walking distance of restaurants,  the T, and anything else we wanted to do.  We loved the history that surrounded us.  It is a quirky little place but we enjoyed our stay."
675,The apartment was perfect! Super clean with everything we could want or need! Wifi and TV worked with no problems! The location was ideal- easy access to great South End restaurants and a short walk to Back Bay or Fenway! I would definitely recommend this place for a stay in Boston! 
676,"For the price and location ($90/night, 10 minute walk from Hynes Convention Center), it was worth the stay. It's a small studio apartment in an older building. The apartment was clean and warm. The walls are not soundproof, so like most low- to mid-range motels you can hear neighbors if they're loud, but it was quiet after 10pm when I stayed. One piece of advice: be sure the electronic door lock is engaged (check from the outside after you leave); if not, flip the switch on the inside."
677,"Well sized room for two people with the basic necessities which also included a mini fridge. Our room, the common areas and bathrooms were clean when we arrived. There were good kitchen facilities but we did not have to use them. 

Overall good value for a location that is close enough to downtown Boston. "
678,"This was a good, convenient place to crash for the night. There is some noise from the airport but it didn't bother me. It wasn't air conditioned but with the windows opened I slept comfortably. I do feel like it's worth mentioning I didn't have a way to lock my bedroom and the bathroom didn't lock either. And the shower was disgusting but those are my only complaints. Very much appreciated the breakfast food left out for guests and the overall convenience of the stay."
679,"Jose was always available. Feedback and Directions were great - fantastic location. Local corner coffee shop for breakfast... Excellent. Salem Street right around the corner. 
Lots of stairs to clime, 4th floor - don't bring lots of luggage.  Bed was quite comfortable. Apartment Needs to be cleaner. Bathroom has seen its better days, needs repairs. "
680,"The apartment was just like the pictures. It was lovely, clean, heat worked well ( I was there for two snowstorms and very cold weather) property manager very quick to respond when I called her. Very convenient to my son's apartment. I would definitely come back!!!!"
681,I would like to echo all the wonderful reviews here. I stayed for four days on a recent trip and everything was just lovely. The room and entire home are beautifully decorated and super clean. The Carney's are warm and gracious hosts. The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet and a nice respite after sightseeing in the bustle of then city. This is where I will stay on any future trips to Boston.
682,"I had a wonderful stay here! I felt warmly welcomed by Sarah and her brother, who lives here as well, and all my needs were provided for with touching kindness and care. They are lovely people; Sam even walked me to the bus/train station and stayed until I'd found the right bus for Cambridge! It's a nice neighborhood close to the heart of city and imminently walkable to and from if you're up to it, and the T and buses are pretty easy and close. My room was very private, clean, and QUIET (except for some Logan Airport action overhead in the morning). You can lock your stuff up here with no worries. They offered me meals as well, and I felt very at home and welcome in every way. 

This was the perfect overnight bed for me - affordable, comfy, close to where I needed to be, easy in and out, free parking, with great hospitality and no hassles or anything unexpected. I'd be happy to stay here again, anytime. I had a great experience."
683,"I didn't actually get to meet Soledad and I was only in the apartment for 1 night but had a blast. I was staying in 1 bedroom and there was also 1 other Dutch guy and a German couple there too. Everyone was really nice, had a lot of fun sitting around at night and talking etc. The apartment itself is really well equipped, with all utensils that you could require in the kitchen, beds are comfortable and bathrooms are really nice and clean. Soledad makes it really easy to find your way around and makes you feel right at home! Would definitely stay here again if I came back to Boston. The street itself can be a little hard to find (I did end up at a different street of same name at the wrong end of town!), so make sure you know exactly which street to go to before you leave!"
684,"Had a great time in Boston! Susan was super helpful, and very accommodating. She runs a very friendly, clean BnB in a nice area with easy access to the RedLine subway to get you anywhere you want to go in Boston. Thanks Susan!"
685,"Great host, comfortable bed, location is perfect "
686,Anna was very accommodating to our needs. She is a very responsive host. My friends and I enjoyed our stay. The apartment was definitely what was advertised in the photos. I highly recommend renting her place. 
687,"Beautiful and charming multi-unit home, perfectly maintained and 10-15min from everything I needed (conference center, Seaport, North End and Financial District). This a slick operation. Do not hesitate to work with these guys! I saved thousands vs. using a hotel this week. Thank you Mr. Swank and to everyone on the Swank team!"
688,"Vicki was wonderful. Great place, great location, great host. Absolutely recommending to anybody. "
689,"We are just heading home from our lovely stay at Megan and Chris' place. Their home is located in a quiet residential area, very convenient to the train with many amenities in a short walking distance. We had no trouble with check in or out. Their home is warm and cozy, very accommodating to guests. The hosts are friendly and helpful and we would recommend this spot to any of our friends traveling to Boston. "
690,"Just a perfect new house in a very nice and safe neighborhood super convenient to the grocery store, restaurants, shopping, bars, and Harvard Square.  Todd is such a great host, he's super friendly, helpful, and his place is immaculately clean!  It was easy to get around too, the bus stop is right at the end of the street.  I would definitively recommend his house again. "
691,"This was our first time using Airbnb and it was a great experience.  Lisa was a great host and we would definitely stay here again if ever in the Boston area.  The bus/train  cards she provided made it very easy to get around and enjoy the city.  The rooms were clean, comfortable and accommodating.  Thank you, Lisa for being such a great host!   "
692,The listing was exactly how described and perfect for our in and out of trips to the city all weekend. The room was (website hidden) was fun to experience on a weekend as well! Awesome location in regards to the T as well. 
693,"Good communication and prompt replies. Room is as photographed and lightly furnished (bed, desk, chair). The house has several airbnb rooms and is about a 8 min walk from the T (subway). Joe is polite & helpful as were the other airbnb'ers staying there. Use of the laundry was a helpful addition."
694,Thank you for this first airbnb experience. 
695,"Staying here was great, set in a beautiful, central part of Boston, access to everything is super easy. I didn't meet Tiffany but she was very accommodating when I arrived early. Despite having a shared shower and toilet, I hardly saw anyone over the course of a week. Highly recommended. I'll gladly stay again. "
696,"Lisa made us feel very welcome from the moment we got there. She allowed us to leave our bags before check in time and after check out time wich was really convenient. The snacks and bottle water left in the room was a nice gesture we greatly appreciated. The T passes a plus. The room was exactly like the picture, very clean and comfortable. Kitchen and bathroom spacious and clean. We did not have a chance to enjoy the rest of the house as we were out from early morning to late at night touring the city. Lisa was attentive to our needs and very helpful.
The Arnold arboretum was a pleasant experience, conveniently located and with a fascinating view of the city.
We loved our stay and would do it again and recommend it to family and friends.
Thanks again Lisa."
697,Had a wonderful time staying at the Top of the South End Brownstone. Sarah and Ben were very accommodating hosts. Highly recommend.
698,Great neighborhood.  Easy access and a wonderful apartment.
699,"A perfect location for walking through Cambridge shops and Harvard Square. Jannah's apt. is beautifully furnished with antiques and bright new paint.  Our room was cozy, the bed comfortable and the sheets clean and crisp. Sharing the roomy bathroom wasn't a problem. I loved sipping my morning coffee in the living room.

Most of all, our hostess is a joy to talk with, gracious  and anxious to make our stay as comfortable as possible. We stayed eight days and hated to leave. "
700,Taskin was welcoming and the room was clean and cozy as advertised. It was a convenient location and a really great value place to stay. No negative comments to be made. 
701,Very responsible
702,"Sparkling best describes this apartment. Jason was an excellent, friendly, and approachable host. He really had all angles covered for his guests, providing us with useful information like parking and where to get some good pizza. I look forward to my next trip to Boston and staying here again. "
703,"Great location, easy access and host was a good guy. Thumbs up"
704,"This was our first Air B&B experience and we found it great. This is a beautiful home set in a lovely, friendly neighbourhood   The facilities were very good and our room was very spacious . Although we were too busy to meet Victoria all her pre trip messages were friendly and helpful this property represents good value for money. "
705,"Staying at Tim's was a great experience. The room was exactly as described and we had everything we needed. The location of the apartment is great and we've been able to do walks during the night all through the bunker hill park and around. 
I'll definitely recommend.
"
706,"Had a wonderful stay in Somerville at the Dural home! Everything was clean, and as it turns out the location was great! Host was very nice, and the wifi worked."
707,The apartment was wonderful and very comfortable. Recommended!
708,Fantastic space that could easily host more than the three people we had in our party
709,Jez is a very nice guy. And the room is very clean and nice. 
710,"Thank you so much for a wonderful stay Sophia!

The location is perfect - in Chinatown and surrounded by great Chinese restaurants and small businesses.

The apartment is nice, clean, and everything is as described in the post. Bed is soft and very comfortable. 

There were maps, notes, recommendations, and contact info sheets in the bedroom upon arrival. Communication via AirBnB mails, phone calls, and text messages were very fast and check in/out were smooth and convenient.

The only thing is that I am a very light sleeper. Individual AC in the bedroom was a little loud, and it sounded like some utility machines outside of the apartment as well. I was having trouble falling asleep the first night due to the noise; however, I was able to get some ear plugs from nearby CVS on the next day, and I have no problem sleeping after that.

Thanks again Sophia and it was a wonderful stay!

Addie


"
711,"Sid's apartment is in a very nice, quiet neighborhood.  It is well described on the airbnb site.  Very comfortable bed.  We only met Sid briefly, but he was available by phone for arrival information, (and also if we would have had any other questions).
Minor issues which do not reflect on quality/value:  noisy refrigerator near bed and no Windows - just a sliding door next to the bed."
712,"My boyfriend Scott and I had an amazing time staying at the Green House in JP.  The place is wonderful! We were so happy when we opened the door!  We arrived late, and Andree was leaving town early the next morning with her kids, so we never met.  The place was very quiet and private and delightful!"
713,"Very nice apartment. Extremely easy, convenient process for getting in and out. Great host!"
714,Nathaniel and Jon were great hosts. Very accommodating and we appreciated had sharing of their apartment. They also allowed us to leave our bags there on the day we checked out and Jin then met us there before we went to the airport. 
715,Great experience loved Tanias home.
716,"Great place! Kevin was very nice and accomodating. He checked in on us the first day and was available for anything we might need.
The apartment is exactly as advertised, fully equipped and in a great area of the city with lots of restaurants and beautiful streets. Everything looks new and is super clean.
We wish we could have stayed longer!"
717,The apartment is in a fantastic location in Back Bay. Beautiful views onto the Charles river and very close to excellent shopping & dining options. Marina was always very prompt in dealing with any queries and went out of her way to accommodate requests. The apartment is very tastefully decorated and a really pleasant place to stay. So much more character than a hotel. Would not hesitate to book here again. 
718,Rosalia and Blackjack were great hosts. Lovely apartment and really comfy bed and room. Only stayed a short time but felt very welcome and was given good recommendations for places to eat and go etc. Nice area and not far from great places to see and do. Would thoroughly recommend staying with both Rosalia and Blackjack. 
719,Brij is a great host! promptly accepted the request and was very accommodating. Will plan to book the next stay here. 
720,"The apartment itself was wonderful.  Great space, full kitchen, fabulous shower.  The location right in the heart of the North End was fantastic.  Easy access to public transportation and easy walking to incredible restaurants and historic sites.  Florence responded quickly and was easy to reach when I had a question.  Only downside was the noise.  The building itself is not very sound-proof and you could easily hear people both talking and moving around in the apartment above.  Also, lots of street noise.  Not a great place if you are a light sleeper unless you bring ear plugs."
721,"Before we arrived, Terry had already welcomed our two friends who had come from Maine to meet us. All three (and Terry 's cat!) were in his apartment to greet us. Immediately, we felt at home in Terry's bright and comfortable living-room (refreshments provided); we made use of the impeccable facilities before heading out on foot for a meal nearby.
The following morning (Saturday), Terry took us on a walking tour of the neighbourhood - a park covering the Orange Line, past the Christian Science Center to the Prudential Center for breakfast (not good value!), then through the Back Bay Fens to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum (where we met again our Maine friends). All this time, Terry provided us with a relaxed and well-informed tour of the locality, pointing out social changes, schools, architecture etc. We discussed academic, social and political life in Boston and Ireland (on the day following a significant referendum, back home!) 
That evening, Terry recommended a good Italian restaurant (excellent food, good value, but noisy!) nearby where we dined with our Maine friends, before taking an early(ish) night. 
In the morning, there was no problem leaving our luggage in Terry's while we set out to explore Boston Common & Beacon Hill before collecting a hired car, then back for our luggage and out of town ...
Throughout, Terry was informative, helpful and charming. It would be hard to ask for more of our first AirBnB experience! Many thanks, Terry, from both of us!"
722,"Staying in East Boston was a really practical way to see the city & surrounding area - we could get to the airport easily on the odd occasion that we wanted to hire a car for longer trips, but easily got in and out of Boston on the 'T' for everything else we wanted to do. The house gave us room for everything we needed, with a good mix of adaptable living and sleeping space. Very welcoming help from Joan and Charlotte. Thanks. :-)"
723,Listing was accurate. Neighborhood was easy to access and made it easy to get around town. Place was clean and quiet. I'd highly recommend this listing to others as a convenient and restful place in JP. 
724,"Once we established the process, picking up the keys and checking in and out was very straightforward. Apartment has a great view of the Charles and is a short walk to Newbury St. A comfortable apartment in a perfect Back Bay location."
725,"Very nice space, in a quiet part of the North End, but very close to all the action. You will everything you need in the apartment. We slept two people on the couch and it is comfy. Paolo was a wonderful host. We forgot a kindle in the apartment and with his help we were able to retrieve it by the next the morning. So, highly recommended!"
726,"We had stayed for one night at the Westin Boston Waterfront hotel before moving into Tiffany's wonderful home and let's just say that our stay at Tiffany's beat the so-called ""AAA Four Diamond award-winning hotel"" by miles!! The beds and bedsheets were much more comfortable, we had free Wi-Fi (the hotel did not), Tiffany's home was much (much!) cleaner, warmer and not as dry, the area was nice and quiet and within walking distance to the subway and other activities. Our host was awesome! She really went out of her way to make us comfortable and feel welcome on our trip to Boston. We had a chance to meet with her and we loved her instantly! We wanted for nothing and we had all the amenities that we could wish for and more! She left clear instructions on how everything worked from the Wi-Fi to her own personal reviews on which places to go eat. Our group was in town for a conference at the BCEC and some days were so busy we hardly had time to eat; all the treats and food Tiffany left specifically for her guests really came in handy at the end of the day. It was our first airbnb experience and if they are all like this one, we'll never stay in another hotel again! 
Would come back to stay here again! 

Vi, Leila and Sylvia (from Montreal) "
727,The directions were great and the place was very easy to find from the airport. The room itself was super quiet.
728,"Matt's apartment is spacious, comforty and has a lot of light. The neighborhood is the best! Subway is a 5 min walk and lots of great stores/restaurants nearby. I would definitely recommend this place to friends visiting Boston. Also loved the kitchen and the huge (oh my) TV. Matt was very nice. He always gave a very quick response to my questions. The place is maintained by his friend Nick, who is also nice. 

The only tiny thing: the apartment is very dusty. I think people with astma/long problems should reconsider staying at this place. "
729,"The app was cleaned up and very well located. The kitchen has everything you need, the couch was comfy and the Wifi was fast. A nice app for vacation! We really enjoyed staying there! 

From the North End it is easy and comfortable to travel to all the different sights in Boston - downtown as well as Cambridge."
730,"Victoria was friendly and we had a pleasant stay, she kindly let us drop off our luggage early.  The room was charming and spacious, with ensuite bathroom.  The kitchen was ample with many amenities.  Conveniently located in the heart of Jahmaica Plain, with easy access to the city by bus and subway."
731,"Personally the unit itself was very clean, and the bathroom pristine. Yes, the host does leave her dishes out overnight, but it is her home after all. Her dishes did not inconvenience me in anyways. Everything else was good and I really like the smell of her apartment! It has a sweet, fruity smell (: Did not have any problems with the smell of Subway downstairs wafting up. 

However, the walls of the place are really thin. The first night I stayed there Subway forgot to turn off their music and I was up all night listening to repeats of Let It Go. The third night the tenants upstairs were probably having a party and I could hear them talking, walking and stomping (what it seemed like to me) about. The earplugs that were provided did not really help. However, my boyfriend slept soundly throughout our entire stay. My advice is if you are sensitive, like me, this may not be the best place.

Again, this is not a hotel so do not expect to receive hotel class service. Alexandra is rather quiet, but she will gladly answer any questions you have."
732,"Shelly's place was just what we were looking for, a quiet bedroom to retire after our adventures in Boston during the day. Great bathrooms, a comfy bed, and everything as pictured.

The address is a little quirky, which caused trouble for our uber drivers, but if you're driving or taking public transit you won't have any problems."
733,Bryan's place is well located and was exactly what I needed for a couple nights in Boston. Great apartment.
734,"This home was beautiful and so easily accessed with the subway just steps away.   If anyone is concerned, the subway's noises were barely noticeable, if at all.  Lauren made sure we were comfortable and knew how everything worked in the home.  We had plenty of room for all four of us and all our things.  Her recommendations for restaurants and points of interest were great.  We left our stay here feeling very grateful for the opportunity to stay here and, maybe, also feeling a little inspired by her sense of aesthetic and organization!"
735,"Number one issue. Parking. Taskin has no protocol for multiple vehicles. After seeing another guest in the driveway, I was forced to park in the street where resident permits are required. I received a $50 parking violation. When I asked Taskin about it I received no reply from him.

Room is as shown I pictures. Very basic but clean with access to kitchen and wifi. Good location besides parking issues."
736,The apartment was a decent place for a quick stay and a lot cheaper than hotels in the area. It was clean and there were plenty of restaurants within walking distance.
737,"The apartment was great and Jason was terrific.  The place was everything it was advertised to be--looked great, very comfortable and homey, great location and have everything we needed for a great stay in boston.  Jason met us on arrival, provided us with cookies and a bottle of wine and went out of his way to be helpful.  "
738,"The home in Malden was too full so Joe put me in another home of his in Somerville which is closer to Downtown Boston. So this is was a lucky turn if events for me.
There was a problem with the Wi-Fi but Joe promptly gave me access to another while the first got fixed."
739,"My father, two brothers and I stayed at Wendy's place over the weekend in order to go to a game at Fenway. Wendy's place was exactly as described in the profile and the place was immaculate upon arrival. I believe she has a dog that lives with her but you couldn't tell as there wasn't a hair to be found anywhere, which is great considering I am allergic! Her place was very close to Fenway and downtown. We found The central location superb and we would definitely rent from her again in the future."
740,"I had a very nice experience staying with ToRena.  She was hospitable, helpful, and checked in with me to make sure my stay was enjoyable.  The neighborhood was not ideal but I ultimately felt safe in the apartment.  The rooms were comfortable but were pretty hot, as there was no air conditioning; however, I did have access to fans.  Overall, I would certainly recommend this listing!!  Thank you for hospitality, ToRena!"
741,"My partner and I stayed with Sarah for the weekend for a wedding in Boston. Sarah was a great host and shared coffee with us in the mornings. We didn't see her a lot but when we did she was friendly and helpful with great tips of what to see in the city when we had free time. The room is cozy and bright - but with shades to keep out the sun if you want to sleep in. The bed was comfortable and there was a closet and drawers for our clothes.  There was a bathroom just for us which was clean and tidy. The apartment location was just perfect!  A block from the heart of Chinatown and a short, lovely walk from everything we wanted to see. If we go back to Boston we will definitely look at staying with Sarah again. "
742,We had a lovely time staying in the cottage. It was well equipped with everything we could need. Susan was very friendly and helpful and knowledgable about the local area. 
743,Very clean and convenient location. Apartment met our expectations and more. Highly recommend to anyone.
744,My experience was fine. I got what I expected and there were no problems with my stay. 
745,The host communicated well prior to our arrival a days once I texted her that we arrived she promptly showed up to let us in.  We were quite concerned with the neighborhood  when we arrived since there  were boarded up houses and it appeared to be a VERY run down area.  As we awaited her arrival we think  a drug deal was occurring  one house away.  The apartment was nice and as pictured however there was one ac unit for the entire apartment  and a lingering  odor of cigarette smoke.  Immediately after Sarah left we made some calls and found a safe hotel for our family to stay.
746,"It was our first accommodation by the AirBnB and were lucky to stay in with Jeff and Katie. They are excellent hosts, give all information that you need, all the privacy and freedom that you want. At the same time, they are always available when you need it. 
The apartment is as shown in the pictures, very comfortable and cozy. The bathroom is really private and very well equipped (also with tub). 
We use car and not use public transport, but we have seen that it is quite easy to access. It's a bit far from downtown, but the travel time is fast and quiet. There are also shops, markets and food not very far, but also advise you to buy your groceries and prepare your own meals, since the kitchen is very well equipped and spacious. 
Dogs are lovely and quiet and the cat appears very little. 
Thus, we consider the great price for what they offer and we indicate to everyone to stay here.
We hope to return soon and certainly we would stay here again."
747,"Great stay! Listing was accurate, place looked just a nice as the photos, it was exactly what we needed. Andrew was vey quick to reply to any questions. Location was perfect for a walkable experience in Boston!"
748,"Excellent accommodation, especially after a nightmarish stay at another place just before. Quiet, spotlessly clean, and the host was a delight to talk to (although mostly I had the place to myself). While I didn't get a chance to check out the area, it is extremely convenient to downtown Boston and the airport. I will gladly stay here again."
749,We didn't see Shawn often. But this is really a nice apartment. The Bedrooms are clean. The kitchen is amazingly well equipped. There is many big supermarket nearby for about 10m walking. The traffic is also very convenient. The red line is nearby for about 2m walking.
750,Exactly as described. Small place with the necessities for a pleasant short stay in Boston. Convenient location to the hospitals.
751,"Tom was a nice guy, very friendly and accommodating. However, our room was double booked -- we got into Boston and to the apartment around 2am, just looking for a place to crash for a few hours. We were informed that we would have a back room near the kitchen. When we got to the room, someone was occupying it. Tom seemed to have no idea what was going on. He didn't have a grasp on how this incident had come about, and we were then put in a room of his ""partners."" It was a place to stay; not much else. Easily stated a rip off for the amount it cost to sleep in a room for a few hours.

We felt bad for disturbing two people. It would be nice to be able to check into an apartment and know you have a room that is booked in your name, but we appreciate Tom for accommodating us regardless."
752,"I had brief but wonderful stay with Edward. The location cannot be beat with a short walk to the hustle of the popular shops and restaurants but nestled on a charming quiet street of gorgeous brownstones in the historic Back Bay/South End. Major bonus is the newly finished rooftop deck with a stunning unobstructed view of Boston. Bed was heavenly, everything was clean and pristine as described. Edward was a kind, warm, and gracious host!! Enjoyed talking with home about he city he calls home!!  I will absolutely be back for a longer stay in the future!"
753,A fabulous location with everything you need around you and well supplied  apartment itself. Very easy access. To all sites and public transport. Thanks Donna 
754,"My boyfriend stayed in Alejandra's place. This is his feedback: 
""Alejandra was the nicest host I've met on Airbnb. She's communicative, kind and always available. Her pets are adorable and very nice. The place is clean and cute, not too close to the subway but I don't mind a little walking. 
She left me a welcome message and apparently this was her first experience with airbnb. I hope it was as good for her as it was for me."""
755,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
756,"This place was very nice.<a0> Sébastien was accommodating and allowed us to drop our bags off several hours before check in time.<a0> He took the time to tell us about some cool things to do in the area and how to get around.<a0> The flat was clean and as described.<a0> Note: there are a ton of stairs here and the elevator doesn't reach this flat's level so if you are handicapable, or hate climbing 10 flights to get ""home"" then this place might not be right for you<a0>"
757,Peter's listing was fabulous. The room was beautiful and we were able to park our car in a secure place. The train was extremely close by and we enjoyed our stay. The pets were also cute. 
758,"Everything was fine. Afiyah was very nice, the room was as described."
759,"The longest I have stayed at the Carney's. How nice to have some downtime in Boston and have a great spot to stay in. Always the best. I am a ""frequent flyer"" at the Carney's"
760,Great place.
761,"The house and the room were very nice and very clean and the neighborhood was quiet. My friends and I arrived late at night, but Taskin was very flexible with the check-in. It was also very easy to contact him because he answered the messages quickly. I recommend this place to stay."
762,Jesse was an incredible host. He was very welcoming and gave an overview of what to do nearby. It is a great location and very safe. It was my first time at Boston so choosing this place make my stay more enjoyable as I experienced what living in Boston is.
763,"Excellent location, space, and host. Loved enjoying the back patio and the great sound system! The bedrooms are on the top floor and then there are stairs down into the lower level where the kitch and living room are. We had a great girls' weekend in Boston and were very comfortable and had easy access to downtown. Would definitely stay here again! The host even gave us info about where we could park nearby for free."
764,We stayed here for the Boston Marathon.  It was a great location - you can walk from the Finish Line.  The apartment was also very close to Newbury with many restaurants and shops.  The apartment can comfortably fit 2-3 people.  There is a separate bedroom and then a sofa and air mattress for use in the living room.  It has been recently renovated with a nice kitchen and updated bathroom.  Nathan quickly responded to any questions and was a terrific host.  I would highly recommend this apartment when traveling to Boston!
765,"I came in Boston with my parents to visit, and we stayed three nights in this apt. Our stay was really pleasant!
The apt is well located because you can catch the Silver Line bus just in front of it. It is perfectly furnished with everything you need, and the modern decoration is great.
It is a perfect apt for 3 people visiting.
Something to improve: the A/C had just been installed in the room and the window had not been fixed so there was a hole which made the room really noisy (especially at night because the apt is on a crossroad with two major streets). That was actually annoying to be woken up by loud motorcycles at 4am<80><a6>
Except for that, the apt was 100% perfect !
"
766,"We had a lovely three night stay in Joe's flat. It was clean, quiet and ideal for a family, having two bedrooms and a separate sitting room. It is also very conveniently located on a quiet street, only a few minutes walk from the nearest T station. The provision of bagels, eggs and juice etc for breakfast was great as it saved having to go out and find a cafe. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend it over an impersonal hotel any time!"
767,"Becky was a lovely hostess.  Extremely accessible and accommodating, especially considering the chaos that occurred immediately following the Marathon bombing.  I ended up having to cancel my first night and she refunded me right away. Very ethical and considerate.  Love her place!  Her friendly cats are an extension of her own outgoing and lovely personality.  I highly recommend a stay with Becky.  There was on-street parking right outside her building which was a big plus coming to Boston by car, and her quinoa breakfast was to die for!  Enjoy!"
768,I enjoyed my stay form check in to check out. I was comfortable and everything I needed was available in the apartment. My dog enjoyed being to close to Boston Common. There's also a great gourmet grocery store in walking distance with everything you need in the kitchen.
769,Rosalia made me feel totally welcomed. She truly loves running an AirBnB. We enjoyed some chats and even watched TV together. The bedroom was roomy and I appreciated having a small desk and coffee in the morning. The location is very convenient. I would definitely return. 
770,The host canceled this reservation 29 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
771,I loved my stay in this place. Anne was perfect when I needed. The appartment was awesome. The location for me also was awesome. Who will work at MGH hospital is just 8min walk. I recomend this place for sure. 
772,"We had such a wonderful experience staying at Max's place. The apartment building is beautiful and brand new (opened in 2013). It's half a mile from the Boston Convention Center, so very convenient for conference goers. Max was very friendly and has lovely furniture and artwork in his place, plus a grill, heater and full couch on his patio. The sunrises are exquisite. We also enjoyed the huge lounge down the hall, which has million-dollar panorama views of Boston's skyline, a pool table, a full kitchen and a huge furnished patio. The neighborhood is great, lots of restaurants and a grocery store down the block. A great experience, one we would happily repeat the next time we're in Boston. Thanks Max!!"
773,"Molly and Ben were wonderful hosts. I am very glad I was lucky enough to be able to stay with them, and if I am back in Boston, I would jump at the chance to do so again. "
774,"A very quirky but comfortable stay, excellent location and super convenient. Was on a tight schedule so regretfully didn't manage to meet the host, met his associate who was very nice and helpful. I am a light sleeper and I slept very well in Robert's house. Unforgettable stay"
775,"The loft apartment is located in a nice suburb of Boston, and very convenient for the T to the downtown area. Amy was very friendly and accommodating, even when we made some last-minute changes to the number of people in our group, and also ended up needing car parking which we had not arranged in advance. She also gave us a Charliecard (the card for the T system which gets you reduced fares for our whole group, when you load it with cash), which was really helpful, as it was not straightforward getting one quickly when you are only in town for a few days.
The apartment has a lovely small balcony to sit out and enjoy the sunshine too.
At the moment, Amy has some building work going on in the garden which means that the entrance to the property is a bit messed up, but it did not affect us once we were inside. The apartment is a good size for a couple (or at most, 3 people) if you don't need cooking facilities but I would not recommend having 4 people in it, as it is small. Stairways (it is on the 3rd floor) are very narrow, and you will struggle to get large cases upstairs! But overnight bags will be fine.
But it was a great base to explore the city, and very convenient for Fenway Park, as it is only a few stops away on the Green Line. A good value place for a short stay. Thanks, Amy!"
776,"My stay was great! It was a sparse, but comfortable room: perfect if you just need somewhere to sleep prior to catching a flight. I was allowed to check out late and hang out in the wifi enabled common room, too!"
777,"Lance and Shawn were awesome!
We stayed at the Victoria Condo after the initial property we contacted Lance for, was booked. My friends and I enjoyed the place a lot. More than enough room for six people. The neighborhood area we stayed in wasn't rated the best according to the locals but we differ. We met the neighbors and they were very friendly and the street is quite peaceful. Overall we had a nice time in Boston. The ""T"" is just walking distance into the city. "
778,"My husband and I were booked to arrive at Marguerite's the very day after the shoot-out with the Boston Marathon bombers, while the younger brother was still at large and the whole city was basically in lock down! I had only arrived back in the States the night before and was not even aware of what was happening. Marguerite called us first thing in the morning to give us her report on the situation, well in time for us to cancel or postpone our trip. I was very grateful that she had been proactive, thus giving us the time to make our decision. Moreover, she was quick to reassure us that we would be refunded if we did decide to cancel and she would be glad to have us at a different time if we preferred. In the end, we decided to make the trip, but we spent the first night at an airport hotel, only getting to Marguerite's for the second night. (I should add that she took care of getting our refund to us promptly and even arranged with airbnb to give us a bonus coupon to use for our next airbnb stay somewhere! That was going above and beyond, and we really appreciated it!) When we finally did arrive at her place, we were quite enchanted by the hominess of our little basement flat. (Personally, I felt much happier in that cozy space than I had at the somewhat sterile hotel!) We had our own separate entrance and could come and go as we pleased without disturbing anyone. The windows in the main room looked out into the garden where tulips and forsythia were in glorious spring bloom! (My husband enjoyed sitting in the sunshine on the little patio in the corner of the garden where there were chairs and a table.) A bottle of wine and two goblets with a corkscrew were thoughtfully laid out on the marble-topped coffee table to welcome us when we first walked in. (My Facebook picture that day showed my husband raising his glass as he relaxed in the old-fashioned rocker next to the coffee table :) I was a wee bit concerned about the bed being a futon, but, in fact, it was super comfortable (and nicely made up with a pretty Americana quilt--with plenty of extra blankets and pillows handy.) We had our own full bathroom, closet and chest of drawers, a desk to work at, and Internet and a nice flat-screen TV that all worked just great. Marguerite was very welcoming in the mornings, preparing a nice breakfast for us. We really enjoyed chatting and getting to know her and discovered that we had many common interests. (I forgot to add that, after the wine, our first clue that we were going to like our hostess came as we perused the many fascinating books she had lining the walls of our apartment!) Marguerite's home is within easy walking distance of the subway (""T"") and also of one of..."
779,"Well how should I start...  I never met Hermina, because she had a sudden family emergency to attend in Armenia. Hope all is well! Her home is cozy and cute. We met one of the housemate left in charge. We didn't hang out much at the house, but when we were there it was quite and peace as the mornings were. The location to the T lines worked out great. Hop on and go anywhere. The neighborhood may seem a bit sketchy for non-city folks, but harmless. The people were limited of their English, but nice and helpful. We stay two nights. All and all after some mix up due to Hermina's sudden departure, worked out. We didn't need catering to, but if your in to that, then hope for her to be around. I've heard she's a charm. If you go, always remember to leave the key where you found it. That we learned the hard way. Thanks Hermina for offering your home to us. Best wishes."
780,"This is a GREAT place to stay. The apartment is neat, clean and well cared for. Mikhail was very responsive to emailed questions during our stay. It was easy to get in and to ""check out"" and the reserved parking spot was super convenient."
781,"Jim's charming Victorian home was exactly as described: comfortable and warm, and in a great location. My mother, sisters and nieces spent a wonderful girls' weekend in the house, with easy access to the downtown Boston sites and nearby amenities. South Boston is a vibrant neighborhood with much to offer on its own. Parking was a breeze, and we never had to use the parking space set aside for the house, although we were very happy to have that option.

Jim was a gracious host, and made us feel very welcome in his space. When the party grew from the original four to six, he was flexible and accommodated us without a problem. If we're ever looking for a house in Boston for the weekend, we'll definitely try to stay at Jim's charming Victorian home again. 

Thank you, Jim!"
782,"Highly recommend staying with Becky and her cats.  Very relaxed environment, great coffee and fabulous baked goods.  Good local area with bars, cafes and highly-walkable metro/subway station.  Had a bit of trouble with assorted door locks, but that could have been senility or red wine.  Would definitely stay with Becky and her feline crew again.  Martin"
783,"Jenny place is very nice, quiet. She is graceful host and accommodates your needs . We had wonderful stay there. "
784,"Great host, we.spent a lovely 4 days days in Boston. Cool city and host. During our time we didn't see a lot of Tim, however he was very helpful on arrival and informative of Boston. Comfortable living space, in an ideal location"
785,"First i have to say that Alexandra is gentle and made us feel like home. It has been like we knew each other from a very long time.
Second, from a logistic standpoint, pubblic transportations are  well coupled with Alexanrda's house. This makes travelling donwntown very easy."
786,"I stayed at Katys house for 2 weeks. I really enjoyed my experience there, it was way better than a hotel, it felt like home. the house is big, clean, the neighborhood is safe and as I didnt have a car, watertown is very well located, you have a bus running 5 mins away from her house going all the way to Havard square ( only a 10min ride) if you have a bike you can ride there as well, its pretty close.

katy is very nice, welcoming, she's working full time and she's a very busy woman so you wont see her much around the house but she will take time out of her schedule to answer any of your questions or just chat.

I highly recommend the house if you're looking for a place in the area."
787,"The place was exactly as it look son the photos. Danielle and Cory were really arranging they let us in and out at the time of our convenience, that was great. We were really happy with our stay and definitely recommend it!"
788,It was our first experience with airbnb. Barney and his family are very friendly hosts. the house is very lovely and clean. It is located near a metro station from where you can reach the center of Boston in a few minutes. We appreciated staying there and are very pleased to recommend it. We definitely will come back one day...
789,"The house is located in a fine Boston heritage area close to all facilities and downtown. Robert welcomed me and his assistant showed me my bedroom on the 4th floor. My comfortable bed was surrounded by an amazing collection of books and paraphenalia in a large room of 25 m<b2>, such that I had 3 m<b2> to get around. The washroom matched the standing of the house. I slept well that night. "
790,"Sean was very kind and came in to let me into the building. The apartment was very small but worked great for a single night stay. If you are tall like me (6 feet) the bathroom can be cramped, but it's a great bargain nonetheless!"
791,"Alexandra was really accommodating upon our arrival. She arranged to give us the keys even if she was not at home when we arrived.
She also allowed us to us the laundry machine, which we really appreciated!
The room is exactly as on the picture. The beds were actually air mattresses, which we did not noticed while reading the add... The room and the bathroom were clean.
The two negative points are that 1) the air conditioning conducts directly opens in the room and the air conditioning sometimes starts in the middle of the night blowing cold air on your face and making a lot of noise and 2) that the smell of the Subway restaurant spreads in the whole apartment.
Otherwise, the house was located close to the subway which was really convenient to go in town.  The neighborhood was great. There were some cafe and bars. There was also a supermarket close to the subway.
In my opinion, this place is nice for a short stay."
792,"This is a great place to stay! Alex and Matt are so nice and friendly and hospitable, and the kitties are delightful.

The 3rd floor is private (you get the whole floor and it's very quiet), airy and comfortable, also with a super-clean, attractive bathroom. (The rest of the house is beautiful and equally super-clean!) There is a giant flatscreen tv hooked up to Hulu and Netflix, and a giant cozy beanbag chair sized for two that is basically the best thing I've ever sat in. Alex and Matt set up the fire for us so we could have a fire in the private fireplace in the room at night. I had a great time here and our hosts made us feel so welcome. Thank you Alex and Matt!"
793,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Nina's charming house. The bedroom was clean and comfortable, and it was great to have a private bathroom. She also provided breakfast items including coffee, breads and yogurt, and vegan cream cheese for me!:) Oh, and Teddy (the dog) is adorable. 
We also loved the neighborhood and its proximity to the train, as well as some great restaurants. "
794,"Hermina is very nice & accomodating.  And it's great to have folk from around the world visit during both my stays.  Hemina's artistic flair makes the decor enjoyable in all areas.  
   There are numerous good-quality local eateries and the local supermarket, 3-minutes walk away, has dramatically improved its stock of quality & produce & packaged foods.  Hermina maintains a good variety of condiments, etc. for cooking & eating at home.
    The nearby ""T"" (subway) is only a couple stops farther from downtown than pricey west-end hotels would be; and the extra distance is elevated, offering a pleasant view of the south bayside and the neighborhoods.  Plus, Dorchester is a distinct neighborhood apart from downtown, and I found people to be friendly and much more ""open"" to conversation and direction-questions."
795,"I stayed at Christine's home for three (website hidden)'s very close to red line,there are  many shops near the apartment,the room is comfortable, Christine was a great hostess and  her dog is very friendly.I  recommend  her!!!"
796,"Great experience for first time airbnb user.  Although I never personally saw host, contact information was always made available if needed.  Everything was as described.  Enjoyed all the modern amenities and cool location.  So close to Fenway, we had to see a game.  Met a Red Sox player after the game going up in the elevator.  Kinda cool.  Lots of services across the street.  I would stay at this location again or at any of the hosts other properties when traveling."
797,"Melissa was a great host.  She left detailed information about the neighborhood and things to do around town.  The apartment is cozy (small bathroom) but very comfortable and in a fantastic hilly area.  The apartment is centrally located, walking distance to Boston Commons and Cambridge.  Overall it was a great place to stay for a quick weekend trip.  "
798,"This was my first experience renting a home as opposed to a hotel. I was so nervous but that quickly left when I arrived at Marian's home. It was SO comfortable, so spacious, clean, well equipped kitchen had everything you needed. You could tell there was a lot of thought that went into providing comfort for her guests. The location is great as well. walking distance to whole foods, restaurants etc. We will be staying here again the next time I am visiting my grandchildren. "
799,"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience airbnb-ing with Sarah, she is a very kind woman who really cares about the well-being of those staying in her apartment. 

The apartment was exactly as advertised, and the bathroom was shared by myself and one other airbnb-er. There was no curfew and getting into the room was very non-invasive to the house life.
Also, I should mention that Sarah provides soaps and shampoos, a towel, and a store of FOOD for guests. I was pretty impressed.

The neighborhood around the apartment was less affluent than I was expecting, but I was never worried by the fact; I talked to some people around and they were all very nice. There is ample street parking in front of the property, it is listed as permit only, but I was assured by multiple neighborhood people that it was not enforced and I never got any trouble for parking there. 

All in all, my experience exceeded my expectations and was well worth the money. For this price, Sarah could be largely negligent of her guests and still get away with it, but instead her performance was far above average. "
800,"Love this apartment, love the location. Everyone in the complex was so friendly and welcoming toward us during our stay! The place had everything we needed, but nothing more... What you see is what you get. Great for a ""home base"" to rest our heads at night while we were running around town seeing family."
801,"This was my first AirBnB experience and I'm afraid Ken and Jez have set the bar very high!  My son and I stayed only 1 night and had an early flight out in the morning.  Jez and Ken welcomed us to their beautiful home, and actually sat with us to hear about our travels in Boston and Cape Cod.  They are incredible hosts - very friendly, helpful, and easy to relate to.  One of their cats, Winston, thinks he's a dog!  He greeted us and immediately became my son's best buddy for the evening.  

Their home was spotless, the bed was amazing (I slept like a baby), and the location was simply perfect for getting to or from the airport.  I had a rental car - their parking was ideal and it was a 5-minute drive to the rental car return.  

They have thought of everything for AirBnB visitors.  They had towels and shampoos laid out when we arrived, a space for us in the fridge with juice and yogurts, an alcove with a Keurig coffee maker, toaster, etc. and fruit for breakfast.  We left the house at 5 am and they were both up to help us out and say good-bye.

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone.  They are the perfect hosts!  I hope I have an opportunity to return and stay with them on a future visit."
802,"Anthony's place is excellent! Location is brilliant right in the North End and close to everything that is Boston.

Anthony is also a brilliant host. I arrived quite late and he waited around to explain everything and gave lots of excellent suggestions. 

Would definitely  stay there again!!"
803,"Jason was a great host, very responsive and accommodating.
The apartment is spacious, very comfortable, and in a great location.  "
804,"Paul is a sweet heart. He is a fine young man with a gentle loving spirit. He picked us up from the airport when we arrived and on the day we were leaving Boston, he delivered our luggage to the NorthEnd Metro station so we didn't have to drag them thru different Metro transfers. His apartment is very tastefully decorated. The apartment is just a few minutes walk from a Metro Station, so is very convent. I would recommend anyone who needs a place for few days while in Boston to stay with Paul."
805,The apartment was at a very prime location on Newbury st with easy access to restaurants and shops and the room is very spacious and clean. Ryan was warm and welcoming. I would definitely come back again for my future visit in Boston!
806,"Tim was an excellent host. The apartment was exactly as described---no surprises at all.  It was clean, cute, and very comfortable. The neighborhood is amazing. Close to tourist attractions, yet a real, safe neighborhood. Tim was great with logistics, like accessing keys, too. He met me in person at the apartment, and explained  a bit about the apartment. A nice touch. "
807,"Curtis' place was pretty good! We arrived late but he prepared everything we needed.  We never saw Curtis in person so I'd like to think he was a ninja watching out for us in the shadows. The place was quiet clean and comfortable, having 3 bed was awesome. The neighborhood was not the best but since Curtis' sister lives in the apartment below it made everything better."
808,"What can we say, stay at Ray's. Seriously, the place, location and host were all perfect for us. We wanted to stay in JP (Jamaica Plain), and Ray's place is in the heart of it (we're looking at you FoMu and City Feed & Supply). We wanted to be near bicycle paths, and Ray's place is close to Hubway bike rentals and both the Jamaica Pond path (go for sunset) and the Southwest Corridor path (picking it (email hidden)ation). We also wanted public transport options, and Ray's place is near both the Orange line (Green St) or the 39 bus (very close). We wanted a comfortable and cozy stay, and we slept really well in the comfortable bed with options of ceiling fan or AC. We wanted an easy going and like-minded host, and Ray not only made it easy for us to be self-sufficient but he also was happy to engage with us on a range of topics from yoga and the barter economy to sugar addiction and bands of all sorts. After such great conversations, we found ourselves playing 6 Degrees of Ray -- we hit 2 degrees. Thanks, Ray!"
809,"Great studio! Rafael was very accommodating when we arrived late, he gave me a quick tour and then was out and about. There was a TV, a small couch a cute private yard and open kitchen. If you're planning on staying a few nights or just one night, I highly recommend it.  Great part about the studio, it's walking distance from great restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores so you can't go wrong! "
810,Awesome place and fantastic host. Definitely stay again I ever going to Boston again! I was staying 2 nights with my friends whom came from Taiwan. It's very convenient location. 
811,"Charming apartment, nicely decorated and furnished, photos give accurate picture of the rooms. Large enough that the 4 of us who stayed here never felt cramped. Appreciated that space was left for us in the refrigerator for our breakfast items. Really enjoyed the Jamaica Plain area, convenient for shopping (walked to Whole Foods) and restaurants (would highly recommend Tres Gatos and Bella Luna), no parking restrictions (we easily found nearby spaces for our rental car), 10 minute walk to the T station. Wifi worked well, no cable TV, enjoyed Netflix after long days of sightseeing in Boston. No microwave, if that is important to you. Shower worked great, plenty of hot water. Harry responded quickly to emails, reservation process was easy, special thanks to Glynna, who so patiently waited for us to give us the keys after we took a wrong turn leaving the airport. 

Although other reviewers mentioned how quiet the apartment is, this was unfortunately not my experience at night. It is next to a gas station and there was quite a bit of noise from there, especially in the very early morning. One night the fuel truck arrived at 1:00 am and took at least an hour. If you are not used to typical city traffic noises (sirens, horns, loud music, etc) it can be disruptive to your sleep.

Despite that one criticism, I would definitely stay here again. Much better than a sterile hotel room! We loved Boston and all it offers, but appreciated coming ""home"" to JP and this homey apartment."
812,"Lily & Harry's place was convenient, clean & modern.  They were helpful and had great local restaurant recommendations.  We'd definitely stay here again."
813,The host canceled this reservation 18 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
814,"Camera molto confortevole, ospiti gentili il mio giudizio positivo, tornerei sicuramente da loro"
815,"Really nice place - functional, charming, always quiet and clean. Molly and Ben are greats hosts, thoughtful and welcoming. Easy access to subway. Absolutely worth it!"
816,"This was my second stay at the unit (though I was in a different room) and again my stay was fantastic. The room was spacious and immaculate. Soledad and Rodrigo are so great and responsive in their communication and make every effort to assure that your stay is a comfortable one. The internet access was great, kitchen was fully equipped and the location is central. I felt very safe walking and driving around the neighborhood. And the affordability cannot be beat. I was in town for a conference and having a comfortable, quiet, close to public transportation, and affordable place to stay was invaluable. If you're a light sleeper I would suggest earplugs, because you sometimes may hear folks coming in. I wholeheartedly recommend any of Soledad and Rodrigo's properties as they put such thought and care into each unit."
817,"Kayla was a friendly and hospitable host with an easygoing attitude. Great location for those who want to get around the heart of Boston (e.g. Prudential, Newbury St., Fenway) easily."
818,"The house is super easy to get to, very close to the metro. Hermina is lovely, she made me coffee and gave me a nice pastry in the morning. The room was nice and large. Overall good experience!"
819,"The apartment was lovely and exactly as listed, we especially enjoyed the rooftop terrace! The neighbourhood was quiet but also not too far from anything. We didn't see Edward much but the times we did he made us feel very welcome. "
820,Fabulous stay! Perfect for what we needed! Wonderful location - Convenient to Boston College. Comfortable bed. Extremely clean home. James and Afeng were extremely accommodating and helpful! It was our first experience using airbnb and were lucky to have been hosted by such wonderful people!!
821,"Very comfortable bed, super clean, everything as promised. Very close to South Station bus terminal, train station, and red line metro stop. We were there very briefly but it suited our needs perfectly."
822,The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
823,"Gerald was a wonderful host, I was very comfortable the moment I met him.  He was very generous with his helpfulness and home.  Real sweet little doggie too!  Laurence Street is historic and beautiful, and very convenient to Copley and the Back Bay.   "
824,"Great studio apartment! Conveniently located near restaurants, coffee shops and transportation. Frank was always available if we had any questions. "
825,"We enjoyed our stay at Lyndsay's very much! The appartment is comfy, nicely decorated and very clean. The location is great for taking the T-train but also close to downtown by car. She always answered quickly had I any questions. I can highly recommend this place if you are in Boston! "
826,"This place was great.  It was easy to find, easy to check in and centrally located.  We would stay here again.  We have two children and the spacious 2 bedroom accommodated the 4 of us easily.  

Jason also hosted several people who were renting to a rooftop cookout and 4th of July fireworks show.  Great experience for the entire family (even the teenager had fun)."
827,"Lisa and Brian were great, gracious hosts. Their large home is a bona fide B&B, complete with chocolates on the pillows, continental breakfast, a movie projector, plenty of guidebooks, and other friendly guests. My husband and I stayed in the Boston Room. Very cozy. Although a bit far from downtown Boston, the unlimited Charlie cards (public transportation) made it easy to get around. Roslindale is also a cute little area with fun shops and decent restaurants. "
828,"We had a great stay at Deborah's loft. It's so spacious, comfortable and clean. The location is in the heart of the city. We didn't bring a car and were able to walk to many places. It's also very convenient to public transportation. Deborah was also easy to stay in touch, gave us a mini tour of her place when we arrived, and answered any questions. She's very pleasant! I'd definitely recommend her place."
829,Place was great and as advertised. Clean and comfortable. Short walk to the best parts of JP 
830,"Pengfei was very accommodating. The location is super close to where I needed to be, and there are a bunch of places to eat within a short distance."
831,"Richard runs a very professional operation, but with a hart. The quality is very high: from the soap (we liked the roses scent very much) to the kitchen equipment and silverware the quality is excellent. The apartment is located in a very beautiful green area in the south end. We only would have liked a little bit more space, as the apartment is rather smallish."
832,"If you are looking to stay in Boston, STAY HERE! Andrea's urban oasis truly is that: an oasis. Away from the hustle and bustle of the 15 minute train ride to downtown lies her beautiful house. It's amazing. Andrea is so nice and accommodating. She is there every time you need her. Jamaica Plain is a fun a quirky area with a lot to see and do. We can't wait to stay here again. "
833,"We felt very welcomed with items stocked in the refrigerator and cupboard, pamphlets and guidebooks.  It was a very quiet neighborhood, restful and easy to get to the transit system.  There were good restaurants nearby.  Our host was very accommodating."
834,Frank was very welcoming. The room was just as described. Very convenient to public transportation. Frank's wife surprised us with coffee and breakfast which we were not expecting. We felt very comfortable there. Free parking was also provided. Very safe nieghborhood. Highly recommend ror visits to Boston.
835,George was great.  Greeted me in the lobby to give me a key and gave me a tour of the place.  Beautiful place with an awesome view of the water.  Would definitely stay there again.
836,Apartment is in great location! Alan left easy instructions for coming and going. It had everything we needed aside from a working oven. Thank you again!
837,"Vicki was very nice, she helped us  getting around, she was interested in making our stay a pleasant one, her home was beautiful, cozy, super clean, location was excellent, it's an easy walk the convention center, we used public transportation, the bus stop was three blocks. It was everything we expected and more!! Definitely recomend it."
838,Great location.  Fun neighborhood.  Super convenient.  Owen was great to deal with.  I highly recommend.
839,"Katharine and Scott were great hosts for us. We stayed only one night but were able to connect with them immediately so our conversations seemed like good friends talking. The house was tucked away with a yard around it, in an otherwise busier neighborhood. It feels like a sanctuary in the hedges. Breakfast was really good! thanks Scott."
840,"This was a very clean, comfortable, and pleasant place to stay.  The location can't be beat and Jazz went out of her way to make me feel welcome.  A+++!"
841,"Aaron was a great host and so easy to work with. We had a crazy schedule while in town and he was flexible and accommodating. The Lyft credits were an awesome bonus and helped us get around easily. He also was willing to take us to the airport at 5 a.m.! We only slept in the room, arriving late and leaving early, but it suited our needs perfectly."
842,"Ravi's place is quite lovely, comfortable, and a fantastic location. Highly recommended!"
843,"It was my first air B&B experience and it was wonderful!!
Hermina is very hospitable, generous and kind to her guests. She makes you feel really comfortable and gets you whatever you may need for a pleasant stay..


"
844,"I can't say enough how grateful I am to have had the experience of staying at Soledad and Rodrigo's place.  I arrived in Boston at 6am on the morning of the Boston Lockdown.  Even though we were not supposed to check in until 2pm, Soledad welcomed us graciously at 8:30am so we wouldn't have to be on the streets during the manhunt while public transport was shut down.  She made the best of a difficult situation, and never made us feel unwelcome.  Plus, the apartment itself was homey and very pleasant.  I really felt that they went above and beyond to make sure everything was in order and comfortable for our elongated stay.  I would recommend this place to every single one of my friends/family.  "
845,"This small room in Beacon Hill was everything I needed for my 5 night stay in Boston. The location is great - only a 5-10 minute walk to either Charles MGH or Park St. on the red line and green lines. Key pickup and drop-off was extremely easy and convenient with after-hour pick up assistance.

Thanks, Tiffany!"
846,"This place is exactly as advertised. A bright and beautiful place, it's easy to reach by car and has convenient parking (though watch out for street cleaners!). We stayed on weekdays, so we didn't see much of our hosts, everything was very well taken care of and conveniently labeled. We had use of a separate bathroom. Everything was clean and nice.

This place was perfect for our needs, as we were spending two days exploring Boston. Easy to park, close to the Orange line subway station (3 minute walk). There were even subway cards provided for added convenience. Would definitely recommend."
847,"Great location, average apartment. The north end is a gorgeous area with the best Italian food on your doorstep. The apartment is quite tight but that's typical for the area I think. I found it somewhat complicated dealing with an agency rather than an individual for this rental, Dror was responsive but when I tried to see if an early check in would be possible I left a message with the agency and on the machine of Gael the super and got no response back. The apartment was somewhat rundown, the coffee pot was cracked and while perfectly adequate, it wasn't the cleanest airbnb I've stayed in. Good air con though!"
848,"We had a great time exploring Boston from this very conveniently located accommodation. The bed was very comfortable, and the rooms were clean and quiet. The kitchen and bathroom had everything one needs, and Tricia was very helpful. We would definitely come again. "
849,"We had a great time in Boston! The house and room was just as on the pictures and very very clean. It is well located in a nice, safe neighbourhood and ideal to visit Boston city center as well as Harvard and MIT. The only issue was a bit the communication. We were allowed to leave our luggage in the corridor after checking out, but when we came back no-one was there to let us in. Luckily a guest opened the door for us. Nevertheless it was a great accomodation we definitely recommend. "
850,Very nice and quiet neighborhood just a few minutes outside of central Boston.  Danish was very helpful and welcoming.  Definitely a perfect place to come back to at night after a Boston adventure.
851,"The room was perfect, in a really nice house with a lot of charm. The neighborhood was calm. 10 minutes to T, and then 15 minutes to downtown. The hosts were really considerate, providing us with breakfast, bathrobes, bath products, etc. We loved our stay at Carney's family and we recommend it to anyone who wants to visit Boston!"
852,"The Pink Room was everything I could have hoped. My roommate and I joined Andrea at her home in the Pink Room for the 4th of July weekend and our stay was absolutely perfect. 
The Pink Room is located in a stunning part of Boston, and it is easily accessible to the city center within minutes by public transportation or car. Andrea gave us a warm welcome tour making us immediately feel right at home. The Pink Room comes with everything you may possibly need during your stay such as towels, a welcome basket with goodies, wash clothes, a TV, fast WiFi, a cozy bed and much more. Andrea is lovely, and we plan on staying with her next time we visit Boston! 
 She gave us great insight on the city and was available for any questions and concerns that we had regarding the city and sightseeing. 
I HIGHLY  recommend staying with Andrea if you are planning a trip to Boston. Andrea and the Pink Room will make your trip worth while!  "
853,"We had a wonderful stay at the Carriage House. It had everything we needed and even more. The place was very clean, comfortable, luminous and decorated with taste. The neighbourhood was lively with stores and restaurants from a short distance walk. Sarah was a great host, very helpful and friendly. We definitely recommend this place."
854,"The apartment was extremely comfortable and although Terry was not around himself when we arrived, the apartment had low lights left on and looked very welcoming.  No complaints at all."
855,"Instantly replied and helped me book the day before. Was totally available for any help. Place was totally easy to locate and effortless to get into. Room was completely clean, as was house. We had access to everything. Very quiet and warm. Even had shelves/hangers, etc! Anyway, perfect hosts, friendly & never awkward. Would totally recommend!"
856,"Nice, practical and efficient, would recommend for a short stay in central Boston."
857,We just had a 2.5 week road trip and spent two nights here. This was our favorite place including other airbnb and hotels. It was very clean and private. Everything they could have done to make our stay perfect was done. Having a place to park was great. Even though the place isn't downtown Boston it was super easy to walk anywhere we wanted. Stephen and Megan were really nice and great hosts and easy to get in touch with for any questions! If we are ever in Boston again we won't hesitate to book here!
858,"The apartment was definitely true to the photos and to it's write-up.  It was clean and well-appointed although we didn't take advantage of the kitchen facilities.  There are so many places to eat out in Boston, we didn't bother with trying to feed ourselves.
The location was great.  There are bus lines and subway stations very close by and the neighbourhood was comfortable to walk around with a coffee shop just steps away.
The host was very helpful and solicitous to our needs and responded quickly to questions before our arrival.  We did not meet her but the instructions for getting into the apartment and for the use of facilities in the apartment were clear.
I would recommend this accommodation with no qualms.  I slept in the foldout ""chair"" in the office space for 5 nights--very comfortable it was."
859,Nigel and Eva are very nice people and they were always available for anything I needed. The room is nice and clean. The restroom is really clean and with all you need.
860,"Great location in Boston--close to many delicious italian restaurants (Salem and Hanover street) and a 10-min walk to TD Garden. It's not obvious to find the entrance but thanks to the previous airbnb reviews we found it easily!

Like other airbnb members mentioned, you can hear the people above you and in the stairway pretty well--but it didn't bother us. I'd say this place is perfect for 2 people (3 is doable but a bit tight, 2 is ideal) looking for a nice, clean and conveniently located apartment in Boston!"
861,Great host! Great food! Great service!
862,"We had five people staying at the house for three nights, and everything was perfect.  Check-in and check-out went very smoothly.  The house is beautifully furnished and very comfortable.  Ten-minute walk to the Savin Hill metro station.  Overall, it was a fabulous experience."
863,"This studio apartment is perfect for a  (website hidden) was perfectly located near excellent eateries,laundrymat and easy walk to the centre.We loved Boston and this excellent accommodation made it a perfect few days.
Highly recommended.
Great shower...a very comfortable bed.Thanks.
"
864,Good communication and very accommodating.
865,"Jose was quick to answer any questions and even let us check in earlier than agreed upon. The apartment looks even better in person -- very spacious and lots of natural light. The location is wonderful, too. I highly recommend this apartment!!"
866,"Quiet, charming, private, great location, a lovely refuge in the city."
867,"I didn't meet Izzy, but his brother is so nice! We talked about our experience in university and watched a football game together with another airbnber. He also recommended me some restaurants in the neighborhood. 
The room is nice, a little bit small but worth the price. I could find almost everything I need. The location of the house is also good, close to the train station and just a few minutes walk."
868,"Overall, Jim's place was great. It was clean, fairly quiet and in a great location. "
869,It was a really nice and convenient place. We discovered this lovely neighborhood with the willy's bar and the south end buttery. It was like living in Boston for few days. 
870,"YuChen was a good host. My brother and I stayed with him in Boston for two nights in summer 2015. Arrival and departure were smooth and YuChen welcomed us with a cold drink! The room had a fan rather than AC, but that was fine for us. We were able to use the kitchen for cooking and there were good transport links to central Boston and Cambridge. I would recommend YuChen's apartment if you needed somewhere to stay while visiting Boston."
871,My friend and I didn't get to meet Christine personally but we enjoyed our stay! The apartment is close to the bus stop and subway station so it was really convenient. Really pretty and clean apartment so our overall experience was great! Thanks Christine! :)
872,"Great location, wonderful house with a fantastic kitchen if needed. Hassle-free communication with the host."
873,"Positive feedback
Good location. Near T.
Good neighborhood.
Good experience with Jeff."
874,"we stayed a bit more longer than one week in July in Mary Kate's apartment and it can be summarised by one word= PERFECT!
All you want is there: Apartment is very confortable, very well furnished and very good size with a bedroom separeted from Dining room . It's also very well located (Prudential less than 10 min by foot and same to reach Grey silverline bus station to join center of Boston with Very good rate also!
Moreover,  there is a terrace on the roof of the building with chairs & tables which is very nice to have a drink after a long day visit with a very good view on Boston! 
At least ,Mary Kate is also very lovely women and was very carefull with us. (i.e take care about my wife who do not speek english very well

For sure I will contact her again next time I will come in Boston!"
875,"We stayed at Urban Oasis for a week in early September for our Honeymoon. Andrea greeted us on arrival and showed us where everything was and how everything worked. Andrea is a wonderful host  and has fantastic knowledge of the area. We tried a lot of the recommendations and they were great, and sadly we missed out on some homemade scones!
The space itself is wonderful. It's like a treasure trove! It is lovely and clean and has everything you could think of that you might need! Take time to read the information that has been put together and collected as it really helped us decide where to eat/places to visit.
We really liked the fact that you had your own space, but Andrea was just at the end of the phone if we needed her. 
Me and my husband would come and stay again the next time we are in Boston, we loved it!"
876,"This is a wonderful apartment in a great neighborhood!  The photos very accurately represent the place, which is comfortable, clean and spacious.  It was a perfect <80><9c>home away from home<80><9d> for my visiting family!  Also, Harry was very accommodating with a last minute guest addition <80><93> much appreciated!"
877,Great view-- and nice loft. Thanks for the stay!
878,"This was my first experience with airbnb and it could not have been better.  Ravi was incredibly helpful, the apartment was in an amazing location and this really made our trip to Boston. The apartment was a bit cold, however with winter in Boston this was to be expected. I would heartily recommend both his apartment and him! "
879,"Was travelling alone and this was just perfect. Was warm, shower worked well and the place had everything I needed. 

Sean had everything set up, he was also friendly and responded quickly during the booking stage. While I was in Boston he was available if I had a problem with anything, which I didn't. 

The street the apartment is on is quiet, and there are supermarkets, bars, subway etc nearby. 

All in all a very good deal. "
880,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
881,"Gary was an excellent host.  He responded very quickly on email and was very welcoming when we arrived.  He gave us enough recommendations for places to eat and drink for a much longer stay and all the ones we tried were great.  The apartment was very clean, a great size and in a good neighbourhood.  The roof terrace was lovely.  Very nice touch that Gary left a bottle of wine for us to enjoy.  The location of the apartment was very covenient for the T and getting into Boston, but there are also great bars and restaurants locally.  I would love to stay in Gary's apartment on my next trip to Boston."
882,"Comfy bed, loads of hot water and fast Wi-Fi, very enjoyable stay !!"
883,Everything was exactly as described.  Peter and Stella were great and made us feel welcome immediately.  We had our 5 month old puppy with us and he was greeted by Buck (the dog) who was happy to share his place.  Thank you so much for everything.
884,"Great spot walking distance to food, drink, and short bus ride to Ashmont T."
885,"We had the best time in Larry's apt,
The neighbourhood is the best location in the city. Cedar St is a quite street that is very close to the main street of neighbourhood (Charles St) and to the nearest Starbucks.

The apt is very spacious and clean. But best thing about it are the cats! Romulus is smart and is actually in charge, and Remus is his sweet sidekick. Both of them really changed our experience for the better, and they made us smile every time we came in.

""A house without a cat is just a house and with a cat - it's home""
"
886,"I did not get to meet Lyndsay, but she gave me restaurant suggestions and was flexible on the check in time, very much appreciated. The room was as pictured and described, the bed was comfortable. The neighborhood was in walking distance to the airport shuttle at the Blue T-station. The places was exactly what I needed, convenient to the airport and local transportation, WiFi internet a bed and a shower. I would recommend it to anyone else needing a place to stay that does not want to pay the high Boston hotel prices! "
887,"Nice stay in Boston, everything was fine. The Sean's condo was little but generous. Very close to the subway. Quite. We enjoy our stay in Boston. Wonderful town...this place was a part of our fabulous trip. Thanks again"
888,"Our host gave a rather accurate description of the house facilities and the suggestions for things to do in the area, which is a very nice one.
They provided us some food for our first breakfast that was also very appreciated! We definitely recommend it.
"
889,"My first visit to Boston made easy by Michelle.   
I arrived late and she took excellent care of me.   Making sure my stay was as pleasant as possible even though I was away a lot.   She replied to my txt msg on anything and even drove me to catch my plane when the taxi didn't show up in the morning.  ( I feel terrible about that since it was 6 am in the morning). Michelle insisted.   She is a genuine Bostoner and as kind as they get I can only assume?   
Roxbury is not down town but close enough.  The flat is spacious an shared with two other apartments.   No conflicts what so ever.  Michelle is a decent baker and although you should not expect it, she might leave a cake or a pie or just something for you to nibble on.   Good place of you will be spending some time in the Longwood mefical area.   
Many thanks Michelle,  I appreciate your hospitality.  "
890,"From the bedroom to the bathroom and kitchen, the supreme level of cleanliness of Doug's residence rivals that of a number of hotels I have stayed at in the past. The commute to and from his location is a little bit tricky since you generally will need to transfer to a bus to get there, but that is more than made up for by the fact that it is a brilliantly quiet neighbourhood and one that gives you a look into a side of residential Boston altogether skipped by tourists. Being the thorough individual that he is, Doug gave me a compete orientation upon arrival about the amenities at his place and everything I needed to know to get in and out of the area. His instructions for catching the bus to the subway and vice versa were clear and concise, and even coming back all the way from Allston to his place at 11:45pm was a breeze. I regret that I only was in town for one evening and did not get a chance to know Doug better, but he was truly friendly and very accommodating throughout my brief stay."
891,"This is my first experience on airbnb, but I'm sure this must be one of my best experience. I'm so lucky to meet Veronika who is a nice, kindly, warmth and optimistic lady. She helped me so much that   beyond my imagination. Her lovely dog，Dennis，and her beautiful house made our trip so exciting and fantastic . The house is so clean that I  always worried about how to keep it. Although our bedroom and dining room is in the basement, we did not feel any uncomfortable ,because the house has a perfect air system which makes the air in the house remain fresh all day long. Since the dining room and the garden are so beautiful, we spent very little time in our own room. There are no pictures of the outside on airbnb, so you will be surprised when you get there. The house is in a perfect block where local people live. It is beautiful ,quiet, peaceful and convenience to anywhere. Five minutes walk to T, to groceries, to restaurants and to the supermarket. Veronika made dedicate breakfast of the fruits and vegetables from her garden, so we can eat natural and organic food every day. I'm sure you must love here as long as you are not the person who is only used to that luxurious hotel. Here is full of love. Here is your best place to deeply explore the life in Boston."
892,"The room is clean and the bathroom is very well done. All the amenities were readily available and we had a fine, private stay at Terry's airbnb. Highly recommended for perusing Boston."
893,Allison's apartment was great--very clean and located in a great neighborhood close to public transportation (and the beach!). We would definitely stay here again.
894,The reservation was canceled 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
895,"I have now stayed with Marc at 315-A on several occasions and remain impressed with Marc's commitment to maintaining a clean and welcoming living space. Aside from Marc's personal space, the gym on the 20th floor is more than adequate and the common area complete with access to outdoor grills, big screen TVs, and a quality pool table make staying here a no brainer. Definitely a 5 star host and 5 star accommodations. "
896,"The apartment is really nice, we were 6 people and had no problem of space. Emmanuel is really helpuful and was always avalaible during the process of reservation. We had a wonderful stay in Jamaica Plain, even if the subway it is not really close having a nice walk through the neighborhood was great (see the pond it is really close and it's amazing). 
  "
897,"Wonderful hosts, amazing accommodations, extremely comfortable, clean, and close to everything!  Healthy snacks and drinks were available which came in handy early in the morning!  I highly recommend staying here, it is close to everything and easy access to where ever you want to go.  Beautiful home in a great neighborhood! It will be unlikely to match this experience.  Everything was perfect!"
898,"I rent Christina's flat for 5 night for a scientific meeting My boss and me attended in Boston.
It is very comfortable, spacious and clean with bed and toilet linen, brochure about Boston and all the possible  information you need inside the flat.
The neighborhood is nice and not dangerous, the flat is near to Prudential centre and Back Bay. Boston is small and in few minutes you could reach every historical o commercial sites by subway or on walk. I'm happy about my choise!
Thank Christina"
899,"The directions were perfect and we found the place easily. The room and bed was clean, comfortable. Totally recommend."
900,"I shared a common space with a delightful family from China, an airline pilot, his wife (working on a PhD at Harvard), their new baby, and the wife's parents. We shared stories and they were ever so kind and considerate.

Soledad went out of her way to be accommodating. Since I live in Mexico, I usually stock up on hard to get items when I visit the US. Soledad took 2 hrs. of her own personal time to take me around to various stores, which I never would have found on my own!

I found the room quite comfortable, good cross ventilation, a ceiling fan, and adequate lighting. The place itself was very clean and everything in good repair. I would definitely stay here again, and would highly recommend it to anyone else :>)"
901,A wonderful place to stay in Boston! I definetely would like to stay there again! 
902,The host was gone the whole time while I was there but he was very accommodating. Nice quiet neighborhood with a 25 minute walk to the green line. 
903,The room was quiet and the location was nice.  Good place to stay for a night or two in Boston.
904,"The studio was a great choice, very welcoming, spacious, well decorated and equipment and most importantly in an exceptional location by Copley Square. Julie was great to work with as the trip to Boston was spur of the moment. "
905,"Jon and Margrit were very welcoming and helpful hosts. Their room was comfortable, quiet and clean. We appreciated the thoughtful breakfast of fruit and fresh bagels in the morning. The building is old but is undergoing restoration as are many of the buildings in this Jamaica Plain neighborhood."
906,"The apartment was big, bright, clean and comfortable; Churchill Suites provided toiletry kits for our group as well as coffee, tea, and other useful items. The location is fantastic: one block from Fenway, close to shopping and restaurants/bars and the T. Would highly recommend. "
907,"The listing was absolutly accurate, and the photos don't do the place justice - we had a great stay, the location is spot on. The place was clean, tidy and had everything we could need, the beds were extremely comfortable. Can't recommend this place enough."
908,"Ray was a lovely host. He greeted us in his apartment in Jamaica Plaid to show us around. The listing includes a private room in his apartment, everything else is shared with the host. We hardly see each other afterwards because of our busy schedule, nonetheless he works nearby is available via phone all the times if necessary. 

Jamaica Plaid is a nice neighborhood with lots of restaurants and cafes. It is great for outdoor activities (nearby Jamaica Pond) and not to far from the city center (25-35min using the bus or subway). 

Couldn't imaging a better place to stay."
909,"We highly recommend staying at Sam's lovely brownstone apartment. When we arrived, she had everything set up to meet our needs. She had bagels, cream cheese, and beer in the refrigerator to greet us. In addition, she provided us with toiletries and information regarding parking and transportation. The description of the apartment was accurate and the neighborhood was conveniently located. There was a  Whole Foods supermarket up the block as well as Dunkin Donuts.  The subway was across the street and to our surprise was not loud at night."
910,"The listing was very accurate and this apartment was perfect for our family of 5.  The location was great in a very safe neighborhood, close to public transportation.  We had a great stay and would highly recommend this as a must stay."
911,"This apartment was fantastic, in a great location in the North End close to many many restaurants, bars and grocers. It was very cosy, clean and quite spacious. Jose responded to all our inquiries promptly and made the check in/out process really easy. We would definitely stay here again."
912,The stay was just perfect! Beautiful room and relaxed atmosphere! Will definitely stay again. I had to change the date of our stay and Barney was more than accommodating.
913,"Sarah is a very charming person. The location of the house is great as the bus station is ""at the door step"" and you can take a bus to virtually everywhere in Boston area. The room and the facilities are also very good. Definitely recommend this add!"
914,Amazing stay. steve was a very friendly nan and felt very comfortable in his home 
915,Meghan was an awesome host and staying in her home while in Boston was an absolute pleasure.  Her home is filled with beautiful objects and art which makes it a charming and welcoming space.  She also thought of every detail to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.  From the simple light breakfast and coffee she set out for us in the morning to suggestions on places that we should visit ....everything was perfect!  
916,"The host wasn't there for the duration of my stay, and it needs to be pointed out that this is a listing for a room in a house that functions to all intents and purposes like a hostel, when I stayed the five rooms (all for air bnb) were each being let out, mostly to couples. With there being only one bathroom, and couples being annoying, this was a little overbearing and it wasn't quite clear in the air bnb advert that the listing is more of a boarding house. 

That being said, it was an exceptional time of the year (NYE) and I can't fault the room itself or the house facilities. The kitchen was a joy to use and I felt comfortable cooking there. It was warm and the bed was comfortable and private. The other people staying were very nice and all travelling through from different parts of the world. If you are looking for a social experience more similar to a hostel, this is for you. Also great for couples. 

The neighbourhood is surprisingly friendly and nice for an airport locale, with a giant supermarket a pleasant and short walk away, some restaurants and the ubiquitous Dunkin' Donuts. 

All in all a useful spot to know and I would consider returning if I was in the Boston area and wanted somewhere that was specifically close the airport. "
917,"The apartment was exactly as advertised (if anything, it's bigger than suggested by the pics), and was extremely comfortable for two of us.

The location was fantastic- in the heart of Beacon Hill and a short walk to Boston Common, the Public Garden, Newbury Street, the Esplanade and the North End. 

As a host Galen was fantastic. Great, prompt communication in advance of and during our stay. Arrangements for arrival and departure were flexible. 

Would definitely recommend and would hope to stay in Galen's apartment next time we're in Boston. "
918,Perfect area to visit Boston. Very quiet.
919,"Jeff was a great host. I never used Airbnb before so he walked me through the logistics of booking. He was very responsive. We arrived about 3-4 hours later then we expected because of traffic, Jeff was very accommodating and we were able to retrieve the keys when we arrived. The size of the apartment is perfect for 2 people, 4 may become a bit cramped. The cable was not working during our stay, but we did not spend much time in the apartment. Jeff was aware of the cable and offered us Amazon Fire. The furniture and atmosphere of the apartment was very modern and welcoming. The couch bed was extremely comfortable and we were left sheets and a comforter, which is important! The location of the apartment was perfect for everything we wanted to enjoy in Boston! All around - Great Stay! Also - Dunkin Donuts, 7-Eleven, and CVS were located right at the corner!"
920,"I needed a place near the Hynes Convention Center and Newberry St., so Kayla's place was in the perfect location.  Easy walk to both locations and on Commonwealth Ave right down the street from the Harvard Club near Berklee College.  The room was clean and very eclectic, befitting a college student vibe.  Kayla shares her apartment with two roommates, and although I wasn't there for very long they seemed easy to get along with.  Kayla wasn't around but was very responsive via text.  My only complaint was although Kayla's room was  clean, the shared spaces were as clean as you would expect college students to be. "
921,"Ravi was a great man and his apartment was located at the best location in Boston. We went to Fenway Park to see Red Sox game and we could just walked back to Ravi's apartment. Copley station was the nearest T station and just a few minutes away. We had a great time here. Thanks, Ravi. We loved Boston."
922,"great neighborhood, host was wonderful, description of property as described....."
923,"We arrived the day after Boston Marathon, so the mood of the city was very sad. However, Kim appartment was a shelter in this city and we loved her place. It is as described in the picture in the most beautiful street in Back Bay (hence in Boston), very close to Newbury Street, Whole Food Markets is a few blocks away. 
This place was charming and despite the events, we had a great time in Boston thanks to Kim.
Moreover, for a foreigner having a phone line on which you can be called from the outside is clearly an asset.
Kim was wonderful with us and sent us the keys of her appartment to another airbnb host before our arrival (as we were away from our home), we was very responsive, very nice and was very worried about us given the events.
I would definitely recommend Kim and her appartment to anyone!
"
924,The reservation was canceled 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
925,"Amazingly charming suite, great location to visit Boston. Close to the Freedom trail in Charlestown. Highly recommended

Thanks for everything again"
926,"The neighborhood is fabulous and the apartment fits right in. My friend and I were extremely comfortable in this lovely, luxurious place. The front rooms were filled with natural light and the bedrooms were cozy and quiet. The apartment is on a popular, well-traveled street but it was not noisy at all and felt very private. 

The kitchen was well-equipped and the amenities reflected a thoughtfulness about what guests might want and need.

Jason was very easy to communicate with."
927,Sean was a fantastic host! He was responsive and communicated well. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the studio. Coffee shops and stores nearby. Public transportation is just a short walk away. You can get around Boston from the apt with such ease! I will definitely check this place out again when I make my way back to Boston!      
928,"Meghan is cool, the room is comfy. It's a very good address in Boston !"
929,Shelley made it very easy to reach the house. She was quick in answering questions on phone and email. I had to catch T and the station was at a 6 min walk. The bus stop is also very near to the house. There are lot of eating joints nearby so no problem at late nights as well. 
930,"nice, clean, well organised!"
931,Very good experience and one of the best places I've stayed in. Not one of the best days in terms of weather but it was relaxing to be able to just stay in for the night and watch movies. The cat was the best part.
932,"Excellent location, ideal for getting around on the subway (next to Charles town stop) apartment was very clean and excellent communication. Perfect studio. "
933,"Easy coordination of our arrival time, easy, clear, simple house guidelines that we loved. Instant restocking of the coffee when it got low. Super clean and nice. 
Mike and Nina were great. "
934,"Pros: Very good location
Cons: Host was not responsive at all. Did not leave instructions despite my repeated emails & calls. When we showed up at the door we still had not received instructions on how to get the key. Internet was not working & was not fixed during our stay. We requested for a 3rd bed and the host promised to send sheets, etc. over by night time. However, when we got home at 9-10 pm the sheets were still not there and we had to call Sean again. Place was not well maintained."
935,"Soledad was really kind. Even though we just met her on our last day, she guided us through our stay with kind notes. The apartment was nice decorated and we met nice people. Our room was big enough and everything was really clean. Only the bed was for us tall Germans a bit small. But all in all we have to stay that we had a fantastic stay in Boston. "
936,"I recently had the opportunity to travel to Boston for a convention.  Rather than stay onsite at the Hynes Convention Center I chose to stay in Jjs Beacon Hill apartment and take the subway to Hynes.  Jjs place is a nicely renovated space (modern appliances, updated kitchen and bathroom fixtures) in a classic row house.  The apartment is professionally cleaned and I found it to be well appointed.  The nearby market allowed me to have peaceful breakfasts in the apartment before joining my fellow conventioneers.  The apartment location provides great walking access to downtown Boston while further locations are readily accessed from the nearby subway stop.  Jj was prompt to address all of my questions and was reasonable in addressing my requests.  It's hosts like Jj that make Airbnb work so well."
937,"Everything about this apartment was fantastic.  The location was perfect, the front desk staff went over the top to make sure our stay was special.  I would definitely stay here again, and would recommend this apartment to everyone.  A perfect location to experience Boston.  We bumped into an employee of Churchill who was extremely friendly and showed a lot of concern for our apartment.  He wanted our stay to be perfect."
938,We had a great stay! The room was clean and self sufficient. You can't beat the location as it is within walking distance to all popular sites as well as restaurants and shopping. Very safe and love the building and rooftop terrace!!
939,"Joe couldn't have done enough for me. I booked at the last minute, he helped me with my bags, sorted out a few necessities, great customer service."
940,"Hans's apartment was great - very spacious with high ceilings and a lovely roofdeck. It also has good high-speed internet access and a truly massive widescreen TV with many cable channels included (it was fantastic to watch some World Cup games on it!). 

We did have a bit of confusion initially over the parking situation, but Hans has since made a note in the listing making it clear that free parking is not available on-site, though he can provide it in a nearby garage for $100/week, which is a good deal for the area. We also did find that there was street parking (with a 2-hour limit during the day) often available just a few doors down from the apartment and were able to use that when bringing in groceries and such. 

I would definitely stay here again if its available the next time I'm in town! "
941,"Vanya's place was perfect. Clean, comfortable, bright, and super convenient being so close to the T. Vanya was also easy to communicate with and flexible with check in/out times. We had a great stay!"
942,The neighborhood was very nice. I had several flight delays and got into Boston much later than I expected. The 24 hour key service was very prompt and got me set up in no time. Tiffany had arranged printed material for me so that I could get around the next morning. The room worked really well for my needs. 
943,"Very friendly and gracious host , because the train we took was late ,we arrived after 1:00 a.m , Maggie waitted for us so late and taught us how to use laundry and charge the card etc. .the flat is great location ,just next the state house and Boston Common ,very convenient to go anywhere! the first floor of the building there are  a convenience and an Italian restautant and a Japanese restaurant ,really very convenient .the neighbourhood of course is very safe. the room is clean and there are anything you may need ,the bed is also very comfortable , my daughter and I enjoyed our stay very much ."
944,"Mauricio's place is located in Brighton, in a quiet and nice area. He is a generous and good host and I would absolutely reccommend his flat to a friend. There is a nice area for walking and nearby is Thai North which is perhaps the best asian restaurant I have ever visited. Inexpensive too. On the down side, there are few in any grocery shops or a trainstation nearby. We used Uber to get around and found this was an excellent solution. All in all, I was happy with the stay. "
945,Meeting Soledad was a delight! She obviously goes above & beyond to welcome guests & to make sure her & Rodrigo's places are nice & clean. The room I had was bigger than I thought it would be & the location was perfect in getting to different Boston locations. I highly recommend this space for future Air BnBers. 
946,"Exactly what I expected...great location, clean apartment, and Sean was very accommodating. "
947,"Michelle was amazing! Any questions we had, she had the answer.  She was great to work with."
948,"I could not have asked for a better host. She always made me feel at home from the first day. She was fast replying airbnb emails and was there when I arrived. The room was extremely clean and she even had towels, shampoo and hand soap ready. She is very proud of Boston and suggested great places and restaurants to go. I highly recommend Suzy. I truly think my stay in Boston would not have been better in a 400 dollar per night hotel. My conference took place in the Hynes convention center and from her house it only took me 2 mins to walk to it. The house is located in a very safe neighborhood. There is a great view of Boston from the room. Internet worked perfectly. In summary, I am so glad I stayed there and if I ever have to go to Boston for another conference I will stay there again."
949,The overall experience was positive.  
950,"We were rather disappointed with this accommodatiion. The host did not even meet us, but left rather complicated instructions to access the keys to the apartment.  We did not meet the host at all during our stay, or even hear from him as to how we were getting on.  The apartment was somewhat shabby, and not really like the image indicated, as this only showed a small corner of one room.  The kitchen was tiny, and although quite well equipped, it badly needed redecoration and a good clean. In addition, the apartment backed onto a yard with three dumpsters, and on 4 occasions we were awakened early in the morning by the noise of the dumpsters being emptied."
951,This was my first time using airbnb but I had a great experience! A friend of mine and I stayed with Ben and Molly. They were great hosts! The room was nice and they had anything you could think to need available even in the bathroom. The fridge had tons of breakfast things as well. They were very helpful with things to do and very friendly. The T (subway) for transportation is a close walk as well. Their kitty was a sweetheart! I highly recommend them!
952,"Listing accurate, clean and well kept apartment. Neighborhood lively and conveniently located. Owner was extremely helpful and available for questions. "
953,The house/room is very good in terms of both location (2/3 mins by foot to T) and interior. Also Nathan takes good care and helped me move in.  
954,Excellent stay.  My in-laws have often used AirBnB when coming to visit and they felt that Damon's place was one of the best that they have stayed in.  Highly recommended.
955,"disgusting, disappointed, dirty. The two matress were disgusting and uncomfortable. The bathroom I can't explain it. In the fridge was some old food. Before we arrive we inform Sean that we would like to use the two beds. When we arrive, we dont find sheets for the seconf bed and we ask Sean what can we do, and he say we can go to find him somewhere and he can give us all what we need. This is service? The idea of Airbnb is ""feel like at home"", but here I can only say ""better go to the hostel/hotel"". I can't recommend it. If you read the comments from other peolple you find that a lot of them say the same like me. "
956,"I felt welcomed and picture is just as described. Perfect place to sleep after going sight seeing Boston. 10-15 minute walk from the Orange line made it convenient and it is also about a 15-20 min subway ride to Quincy market. Joe left the keys where he said he was going to leave them and everything went smooth. Good communication. Perfect place for an economic budget, will definitely stay again."
957,Franklin was a great host and very communicative in the lead up to our stay. The location of the apartment was excellent and it was exactly as it appears in the photos. 
958,"This has been a gorgeous stay, for me this has been a very good presence here, very beautiful house and apartment, I hope i will come back to Boston and if i do i will 100% try to get room there again 
Very good and nice people"
959,"The woman who is the permanent resident/renter was there to welcome us. She was friendly and showed us around. This is a very plain apt. - no frills - and the neighborhood is somewhat seedy, but not dangerous. Many homes have peeling paint, trash in back yards, things in disrepair, weeds growing in sidewalk. "
960,"Molly and Ben are everything and MORE that you could hope for in a host!  They are a bright, delightful couple who are eager to make your stay in Boston a memorable one.  The bedroom and private bathroom is immaculate and they made us feel right at home.  There is a small refrigerator with breakfast items (eggs, cereals, fruit, juices, yogurt, tea, toast, jams).  They are a short walk to the Maverick Station on the Blue Line, making it easy to get just about anywhere.  They helped us get discount tickets to the P-town ferry and to the Aquarium.  We would stay with them in a heartbeat!  Thanks, Ben & Molly!!!"
961,"Thoroughly enjoyed our time in this wonderful house and had the pleasure of meeting Robin & Victoria.
Had never done Airbnb before and the concept of letting yourself in and making yourself at home seemed a little strange to begin with, however Robin kept us informed via text.
The area is great for eating and exploring and has a real community spirit. Transport links are also good. Would definitely stay here again."
962,"Ed was a great host who made our group very welcome. He met us on arrival to show us how the apartment worked and was a mine of local information about local shopping and restaurants. The apartment was exactly as described, very spacious ,clean and well set up. The area is ideal for easy access to the heart of the city and has lots of good restaurants nearby. We could walk everywhere- we used the parking available at the apartment which was extremely convenient."
963,"I had a delightful stay at Chris & Kristina's.

I came in late in the evening and Kristina was very receptive and welcoming. I had no problem to communicate with her whatsoever, very quick on the texting trigger - haha!
Very great place, pictures are the reality, very cozy, trendy, lovely and calm area everything you need is there in a walk. I shall book it every time I'll head to Boston, oh oui!

Merci beaucoup pour tout!"
964,"I stayed with Irina for 4 nights, the apartment is perfect, and very homely. Irina was also a great host, we spent time talking about things to do in the city, places to eat, and she showed me some great views of the city at night. I had a brilliant time in the city and it was made even better by the great Accomodation and host. Thanks Irina!"
965,"Susan was *extremely* rude to my girlfriend and I. She did not inform me that there would be construction during our stay - she did, however, demand that I pay her an extra $20/night in cash. When I declined, she incessantly harassed us; it got to the point that we had to leave one night early (despite already having paid) and we would have contacted the local authorities were it not for help from the AirBNB trust and safety team. If she makes a similar demand from you, do NOT oblige it - report her to AirBNB and leave *immediately*"
966,"  Francine was a wondeful host.She gave us very good instruction about restaurant.And she was warm and friendly to us.Her husband was funny.we were pleased that we spent such a good time in Boston. If we go to Boston,we'll choose to enjoy Francine's room."
967,"The room was clean and it was big, it's near to the bus and subway. We met Taskin and he helped us without problem with our duds"
968,my stay was really comfortable...i felt completely at home ....beats staying at a hotel. very easygoing and considerate host. thanks brendan
969,"Was really disappointed with the state of the apartment...there were dirty underwear on the sofa, all the sheets were piled on the floor and since we got in so late, we didnt have time to wash them.  We werent even sure if they were clean or not.  No hand soap in the bathroom, a box of toilet paper in the middle of the living room.  

Awesome location, a fine apartment, just pretty rude to leave it like that for paying guests.  "
970,"Will and Coli were very communicate before the trip and extremely welcoming when I arrived. They are friendly and helpful, and the room is clean with a private bath. I would not hesitate to stay here again!"
971,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was good. The apartment is in a good location. T and bus stop are only 5 minutes away and going to places couldn't be easier. Kate is such a great host. She was very accomodating - easy check-in and check-out, she even took my for a little tour around the area! "
972,"Staying at Susan and Steve's cottage was a lovely experience! My husband and I were in town visiting Cambridge. The cottage is quaint and well-appointed, and conveniently located to  everything.  Susan and Steve welcomed us as old friends. What a fun vacation! "
973,"Terrible room.
Don't go there..."
974,"Great location, really in the heart of the city and walkable from all of the key areas.  The room was clean and the house was really quiet.  Robert provided me with a key to come and go which was great, and gave me a run down of the area and some really useful local insider info."
975,"Room was clean enough, however outside the room was a mess with plates piled high, trash on the floor probably from his other 3 roommates. Bathroom had dirty towels everywhere. Location is good, host friendly. "
976,"The place lived up to all our expectations. Location is great,  and apartment feels very fresh and clean, with a great kitchen and bathroom. The rooftop deck had an awesome view and was nice and sunny during our visit in May. 

Scott is a very accommodating host, and all contact that we had with him was very smooth. Highly recommended!"
977,"This was the first time I've left a rental midway through a trip. I left and paid MORE to stay in a hotel. I wish I would have seen the most recent review at the time I booked this place (the review posted very recently and I book a couple months ago), because I never would have booked the stay.

Everything in the previous review by Gang is 100 percent accurate. Bare in mind this language barrier, he's speaking to the sounds the heater made rather than the AC. The heater made incredibly loud and awful sounds all night long. While I'm grateful it was turned on, I couldn't sleep at all because of the rattling and shrieking coming from the baseboard unit right next to the bed and in the nearby kitchen. 

Also, the lighting is completely off in the photos provided. The space is very dark. Additionally, there was salt from the recent snow tracked through the entire place and a bag of dirty laundry by the door. I was very uncomfortable with the idea that someone/a company was coming by to pick up this dirty laundry while I was there. I ended up carrying all of my luggage with me to a conference because I had no idea who had the keypad code to this place.

The bed is terribly uncomfortable and, for the current temperatures of 10 degrees at night, there is insufficient bedding available. You're told specifically in the host instructions not to take any additionally bedding from the closet... despite the THIN ""comforter"" provided. The bed is no better than a pull-out couch with a metal bar in your back.

I was so uncomfortable and unhappy with this listing, I stayed one night and left the next day for a hotel. I paid TWICE because I didn't want to stay there."
978,"We had a wonderful stay at Atef's place.  
Charming and nit apartment, convenient location and beautiful neighborhood. But above all, Atef's hospitality was beyond all of our expectations. Kind, pleasant, and helpful. 

We certainly recommend and hope to come back. "
979,"Very nice place. Old apt but is given a modern feeling and like a home. Galen is a great host, reachable and always making sure everything is alright."
980,"Michelle seemed like a lovely woman and I can see why people would enjoy her company. However I felt as though there was a discrepancy with the photos of the room and the actual room. The room was extremely dusty and dirty despite Michelle saying that the place is ""professionally cleaned"". I found quite a few dead bugs in the room that should've been cleaned up. There was also a lot of flies, spiders, and centipedes in the room. The sink and the tub was constantly plugged and the water would always fill up even as I was just brushing my teeth. There were brown stains on the bottom of the tub and the shower was extremely slow. I had to wash my hair by dumping buckets of water on my head. On top of the hygiene factor, I also found that the area was unsafe. Upon arrival I already saw a bunch of men under house arrest hanging around our area and they gave myself and my friend quite a hard time by following us around and catcalling us. This happened over the next few days - being followed and being called extremely nasty things. After some investigation, I also found that a man was shot/stabbed repeatedly just a few blocks away from Michelle's home. That made me feel extremely uncomfortable and unsafe, and I actually had to book a hotel for the last night. Although everyone's tolerance for hygiene and safety is different, I found it unbearable to stay even one more night at Michelle's home. "
981,"We had a wonderful stay in this place and felt really at home after a few hours. Everything has been clean an tenderly arranged, all technical things including wifi worked without any dropout, and the location of this place is outstanding. Also any neighbors that passed by are very friendly. "
982,"Max was flexible and prompt meeting us at the condo early in the morning after a red-eye flight to show us in. Everything was clean and inviting and ready for my family and I to begin enjoying our Boston stay. I liked the surrounding area, the transit was easily accessed and a whole foods market, pharmacy a short walk away. We enjoyed a good meal at hospitable Warren Tavern close-by as well
"
983,The description was accurate and the neighborhood and place were both great! We only wish that the shower drain hadn't been slightly clogged and that the internet had been stronger.
984,"Staying at Ben's South Boston condo was fun. The rooftop deck was exceptional.  Ben was always accessible and made sure everything was ok.  The neighborhood was great - with many young professionals.  The condo exceeded out expectations, and would stay there again.  "
985,"The title is not an over-exaggeration - Ravi's place really is the best location in Boston! Ravi was very accommodating and flexible. He's a great host with a great place. We lived in Boston for 2 years before and Ravi's place provided us the perfect location to revisit some of our favorite old sites while also exploring new nooks in the Back Bay, Beacon Hill and the rest of Boston. Perfect for 2 travelers as the open space is roomy and bed is comfortable. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to explore Boston. It's just minutes from everything you would want or need!"
986,"I was looking for a place to stay near Boston University and found Jen's place. From start to finish the experience was stress free.
All of the details like the reservations, where and when to meet to get the keys were real easy.  The place was well furnished with upscale amenities. The bed and couch was very comfortable the room did not feel crowded. The interior design works well with the size of the place.  The kitchen was on the newer side it has stainless steel appliances, granite counter tops, coffee maker and it was very clean it's the perfect size for the place. The outside deck was nice the seating was good there were padded chairs and loungers it's a good place to relax. The location was great for us we could walk to Kenmore Square BU east campus or catch the T (subway) to venture out. We were close enough to walk to Newbury street for shopping or dining. We also took a morning walk along the Charles river esplanade its about a 5 min walk to the path.
Meeting with Jen was great she was really nice I felt she really cared about making our stay special. She gave us a bottle of wine, had some recommendations for the visit to Boston, and checked in during our stay to know if we needed anything. Overall it was such a nice experience I would recommend staying here. I am planing to stay for our next visit in the spring.





"
987,"I enjoyed my stay at Treetop Haven and Maria Elena was very helpful with valuable recommendations on shopping, public transportation and driving routes. It's a wonderful retreat after a busy conference or sightseeing day."
988,"Brandon is a fine gentleman who runs a no nonsense airbnb. The room is a clean and bright light filled oasis. The location is seriously convenient to the Green line and is in a quiet part of town. There is a Whole Foods just down the road, and the bathroom is right next to your room. I can think of no reason to strongly suggest that if you are coming to Boston, you should stay here if you want an excellent experience."
989,"Great place to stay. The three bedrooms were all actual bedrooms.  Plenty of space, solid internet, clean. And there wasn't any ""home clutter"" which I appreciate. :-)

Jon was also a great host and mailed back a button down shirt that a colleague left behind. Really appreciated the responsiveness of the host and the simplicity of the check-in and check-out."
990,Great apartment location and very spacious. Ideal for exploring Boston. Only downside is its and older apartment and could be cleaner.
991,"Robin and Victoria were great hosts, and we enjoyed our stay in their B&B.

I highly recommend Jamaica Plan - interesting shops, fantastic restaurants and convenient public transport to get into Boston to see the sights.

"
992,These guys are dope. 
993,"The space was exactly as described. The location was amazingly close to all of the activity but nicely tucked away out of the hubbub in a quiet neighborhood with nice parks and walkways.  The space was clean, pleasant and allowed the 4 of us to all have our own space.  We thought we'd be riding the T to get around but found we could walk to  pretty much everything we wanted to do for our weekend stay.   The book collection, including Boston guide books, was appreciated. We loved the view of the Prudential building at night.  "
994,"We arrived very late due to airline delays, and our hostess graciously re-arranged her schedule to check us into the apartment. Our communication with her before and during the visit was excellent. The unit has all the amenities you will need and is located near restaurants and nightlife. We visited on college graduation weekend and were lucky to find this place with everything else booked up!"
995,"Room was exactly as promised, location is good! Bathroom could have been cleaner. Helen is a wonderful host, helps you with everything. For this price definetely a recommendation."
996,"Wonderful hostess and very clean, cozy, accomodations.  Loved the extra touch of a home cooked breakfast frittata served on our first night there.  Overall a great experience at Maria's wonderful home.  Although not closely located to the T line, the home is within a short walking distance to the Orange line.

Highly recommend!"
997,"If I could give Sean a 0, I would. I wouldn't recommend this stay to anyone given the hassle it was for us to stay the night. First of all, if you have questions when you arrive don't expect him to answer his phone or respond in any way. When we arrived we had to drive around for two hours trying to find parking, I had to ask 3 locals where was appropriate to park for that apartment because he did not respond. After finally getting a parking spot, it being 10pm, we followed his instructions to get the key but the key was not where it should have been. He asked us to drive to him to get the key after finding the parking spot. We had to wait for Sean to bike a half hour to give us the key, we didn't get in till 11. The room was decent but the bathroom was much smaller than expected, and could use a good scrub. 
*ALSO, at 10am a couple walked right into our room because they also had a key to our room, and later when we returned to get our things they were in our room again. 
Terrible stay. "
998,Air condition and wifi were terrible also home was so dirty
999,"Had a terrible time communicating to the host. Msgs sent on airbnb for directions came back with a standard copy paste even more confusing directions in broken English. Email sent to host email address bounced and texts were never responded. Calls rarely attended or returned.

I had to take this place just for a night and I took this place due to the proximity to my meeting place. I managed to land at the door and while on taxi I called Robert to update him that am on the way and the response I got was ""ok""

When I landed there I was searching for the door number and then a guy came out from the basement and was kind enough to take the bags to the third or fourth floor of the building. Thankfully it was a small bag else it will be a disaster in that narrow, dingy steps with thousands of books on the sides. Some scary antique stuff as well. It was like a museum. "
1000,"The room was not shown as advertised. The room and bathroom seemed much smaller. There was no kitchen sink, one of the towels provided still smelled like BO, the shower had mold growing on the tiles and the bathroom was much smaller. The bed and comforter provided had stains on them. It resembled a college dorm room. The only good thing about our stay was that we did not have to stay in that room for more than 5 hours. The area it self was nice. Close to the train and Northeastern University. "
